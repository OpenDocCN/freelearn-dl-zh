    user queries and performing specific tasks. For example, when a user asks for
    a flight from Los Angeles to New York, the agent retrieves flight options based
    on factors such as price, timing, and airline preferences. It applies predefined
    logic (e.g., sorting by cheapest price or shortest duration) to present the most
    relevant results to the user. Similarly, if a user requests hotel recommendations
    near Times Square, the agent uses traditional reasoning to filter hotels based
    on location, budget, and amenities.

    destination or itinerary to a user based on their stated preferences and constraints.
    However, upon receiving feedback from the user after their trip, the agent learns
    that certain aspects of the recommendation did not align well with the user’s
    actual experiences or desires. Through meta-reasoning, the travel agent can analyze
    this feedback and introspect on the reasoning process that led to the initial
    recommendation. It might identify patterns or flaws in how it interpreted the
    user’s preferences, weighted certain factors over others, or made assumptions
    about the destination or activities. Armed with this insight, the agent can then
    make adjustments to its reasoning process. It might recalibrate the importance
    it assigns to different user preferences, introduce new decision-making heuristics,
    or refine its data sources to ensure more accurate and relevant information.

    For complex or high-stakes trip planning scenarios, such as organizing a multi-destination
    family vacation or a large group tour, the agent could allocate more computational
    resources to perform deeper reasoning and analysis. This might involve considering
    a wider range of options, simulating various scenarios, or leveraging more sophisticated
    algorithms to generate optimal recommendations. Conversely, for routine or straightforward

    at a final travel destination recommendation. Subsequently, the user may like
    or dislike the recommendation that is marked by feedback = 1 (for satisfied) or
    feedback = -1 (for dissatisfied). The meta-reasoning agent then looks at the recommendation
    it made in the previous step, the user’s feedback (1 or -1), decides on an **adjustment_factor**
    value between 0 and 1, and passes it on to a tool that uses this information to
    update the system’s internal weights. So, in this example, the system started
    with a recommendation with more emphasis on adventure and the user liked this
    recommendation (New York, hence, feedback = 1). The meta_agent then increases
    the internal system weight for adventure to 0.34. This means, the system now has

    To clarify a bit further, the term *modeling* in this context means the agent’s
