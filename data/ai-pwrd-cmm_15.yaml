    particular, they're always seeking opportunities to improve **User Experience**
    (**UX**). Unfortunately, there's often a big gap between what the product team
    wants and what customers actually need.

  zh: 产品团队总是寻找让他们的产品变得更好的方法，特别是他们总是寻找改进**用户体验**（**UX**）的机会。不幸的是，产品团队往往希望和客户实际需求之间存在很大的差距。

    which features to build first, second, and third – or not at all! It can be challenging
    for product teams without any kind of formal process or structured criteria to
    work with. This is where **product prioritization surveys** come in handy. They're
    a quick and easy way for product teams to collect feedback from users while also
    identifying which features should get top priority next.

  zh: 这就是优先级排序发挥作用的地方。**优先级排序**本质上是在决定首先、其次、第三次要构建哪些功能，或者完全不构建！如果没有任何正式的流程或结构化的标准，产品团队可能会感到困难。这时，**产品优先级排序调查**就显得特别有用。它们是产品团队收集用户反馈的快速而简便的方式，同时也帮助识别哪些功能应该获得下一步的最高优先级。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 产品功能优先级调查的目的是为了什么？
- en: A survey such as this is useful because it directly engages with customers as
    part of your product development process. Rather than solely spending time researching
    competitors' offerings or coming up with ideas on your own, you can leverage existing
    customer insights so that your ideas are informed by what people actually want.

  zh: 这类调查非常有用，因为它直接让客户参与到你的产品开发过程中。你不再单纯地花时间研究竞争对手的产品，或是凭空想出点子，而是可以利用现有的客户洞察，确保你的创意是基于人们实际需求的。
- en: It also gives you data directly from real people you know more about than anyone
    else – namely, actual buyers who are already in the marketplace. This is invaluable
    because it allows you to understand exactly what people want, what they think
    about features, and other insights that can't be gleaned from solely researching
    competitors.

- en: Companies that fail to get feedback such as this can end up making products
    that don't satisfy their users' needs and missing out on valuable opportunities
    for greater brand loyalty. For example, a large consumer electronics firm recently
    updated its laptop line, adding all the features that users had been requesting
    for several years. They've come under criticism for taking so long to deliver
    on these features, and for essentially building the same laptop over and over
    again. A product feature prioritization survey would have revealed these improvement
    opportunities early on.
  id: totrans-33

  zh: 那些未能获得此类反馈的公司可能最终会制造出无法满足用户需求的产品，并错失提升品牌忠诚度的宝贵机会。例如，一家大型消费电子公司最近更新了其笔记本电脑系列，增加了用户多年来一直要求的所有功能。由于花费了很长时间才交付这些功能，他们受到了批评，认为他们基本上在不断地重复构建同一款笔记本电脑。一项产品功能优先级调查本可以提前发现这些改进机会。

    which is how some of the largest e-commerce companies communicate directly with
    their customers. Since customers are the lifeblood of your business, you should

    which are an invaluable tool for gaining insights into a user's motivations and
    behaviors. However, conducting individual interviews can be costly and time-consuming.
