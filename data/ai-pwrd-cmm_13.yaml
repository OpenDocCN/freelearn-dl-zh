    customer information, such as demographics, past purchases history, preferred

- en: Or another restaurant could leverage their past purchases to determine what
    items might be popular with people who typically dine later at night or prefer

    base and find new market opportunities based on tailor-made offerings that meet
    people's specific needs – be they food - or non-food-related in nature.

- en: As consumers, we all have different needs when it comes to buying products and
    services. We each have different preferences about timing (early morning versus
    night), days of the week (weekend versus weekday), how much notice we need for
    an order, what delivery method is most convenient (regular mail versus courier),
    and so on.

  zh: 作为消费者，我们每个人在购买产品和服务时都有不同的需求。我们在时机（早晨还是晚上）、一周中的哪天（周末还是工作日）、我们对订单的提前通知要求、最方便的配送方式（普通邮件还是快递）等方面都有不同的偏好。
- en: But being able to know what customers' preferences are before they go into a
    store, website, app, or another purchasing medium greatly increases their chances
    of finding something that fits their needs. It also gives them a chance to see
    if there might be other options out there that they didn't know existed but would
    fit their needs better. This could be for anything from food and clothing items

  zh: 更好地理解购买原因
- en: Customers buy services for many different reasons, which go far beyond their
    financial value. One of the top reasons for people to buy things is to define
    their social identity. It's not just a matter of self-image either – it's about
    being part of a group, which creates a sense of belonging.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 顾客购买服务有许多不同的原因，这些原因远远超出了其财务价值。人们购买东西的一个主要原因是为了定义他们的社会身份。这不仅仅是自我形象的问题——更是关于成为某个群体的一部分，这种归属感对他们非常重要。
- en: In some cases, this can be tied to your community – for example, buying local
    or consuming content that reflects where you live or interests you have. The key
    here is that most purchases are driven by emotions whose roots are tied to the
    customer's community. People want to feel connected in order for them to be happy
    in life – they need those connections and emotional ties.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在某些情况下，这可以与社区有关——例如，购买本地商品或消费反映你所在地区或你兴趣的内容。关键在于，大多数购买行为都是由情感驱动的，而这些情感的根源与顾客的社区息息相关。人们希望感到与他人连接，才能感到生活中的幸福——他们需要那些连接和情感纽带。
- en: People often don't do something until someone else has done it first. This means
    they'll copy others around them, whether they realize it or not. This applies
    as much to the service side as it does with all other purchases, especially those
    purchases that consumers perceive as status symbols (such as a premium airline
    membership) rather than purely functional (such as insurance). These purchases
    are often about identity more than value – they symbolize who you are.

  zh: 人们往往在别人先做之后才会做。这意味着他们会模仿身边的人，无论是否意识到这一点。这不仅适用于服务领域，也同样适用于所有其他购买，尤其是那些消费者视为身份象征（例如高级航空公司会员）的购买，而非纯粹功能性的购买（例如保险）。这些购买往往更多是关于身份，而非价值——它们象征着你是谁。
- en: Our actions demonstrate our values. By dedicating resources to help your team
    engage with customers, you're demonstrating that as a business, you care about
    your customers and value them enough to go above and beyond. This can lead to
    repeat customers and referrals because people trust a brand when they feel valued.

    better, and it's a great way to understand what they think about the offerings
    you provide and why. Using these findings, you can then create strategies that

    data that your customer has already provided to you. Where possible, you should
    look at past interactions with customers and leverage that information to help
    guide future interactions. If there are any patterns that emerge from these interactions,

- en: '**Providing personal customer interactions**: The second challenge is related
    to understanding the context of an interaction. In many cases, today''s consumers
    are accustomed to receiving information through digital channels without having
    to actually talk with another person. As such, providing customers with information
    in an impersonal way can feel unhelpful for both sides involved. In today''s increasingly

    success stories?* These are just two ideas, and there are many more possibilities
