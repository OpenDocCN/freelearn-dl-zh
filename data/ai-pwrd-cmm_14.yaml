    can help product teams fine-tune their feature set and product strategy. For example,
    if a large percentage of users are using your product for one-off use but not
    regular use, this is a red flag that you might want to rethink the purpose of
    your product or its target user. Let's dive into these ideas more deeply by understanding
    market attributes, user wants and needs, finding new use contexts, and more.
