    will not be omnipresent. It will be integrated into everything in ways that we
    haven't even imagined. Therefore, for AI to be designed in a way that can truly
    connect with human beings, psychology will need to remain at the center of the
    design of such experiences. Year by year, we can observe the world becoming increasingly
    reliant on technology, and in some cases, technology fills the void of human interaction.
    This allows us to interact with highly personalized and customized experiences
    that make up feel among a sea of individuals truly unique.

  zh: 为什么心理学对人工智能是一个重要的考虑因素？
- en: By now, you may have begun to suspect why psychology is an integral part of
    the development of artificial intelligence. Psychology is important because it
    teaches us about the fundamental reasoning behind how humans think and behave.
    Therefore, it makes sense for us to find ways to incorporate this into our designs
    when it comes to personalizing, customizing, and automating experiences for users.
    When considering the autonomous role of AI within an interactive experience, it
    must, in some way, align with how we, as players, interact and engage with the
    virtual world; how we interact with objects, **non-roleplaying characters** (**NPCs**),
    and other players. One way to think of this is via cause and effect. For example,
    we perform a particular action such as stealing from different characters or behaving
    badly, and that, in turn, will have an effect on how other NPCs respond to you.
    An excellent example of this is in the game Overlord, where the more that you
    go out of your way to terrorize villages, the less likely and willing they are
    to help you or even interact with you. While it can be humorous, it can be quite
    frustrating too, especially when you need to achieve certain objectives and are
    forced to do it the hard way because now everyone hates you! Therefore, remember
    that to create AI within games, you need to define a metric to evaluate the progress
    of the player and tweak it accordingly as you begin to playtest your game.

  zh: 到现在为止，你可能已经开始怀疑为什么心理学是人工智能发展不可或缺的一部分。心理学之所以重要，是因为它教会了我们人类思考和行为的根本推理。因此，当涉及到为用户个性化、定制和自动化体验时，我们找到将其纳入我们设计中的方法是有意义的。在考虑AI在互动体验中的自主角色时，它必须在某种程度上与我们作为玩家如何与虚拟世界互动和参与的方式相一致；我们如何与物体、**非角色扮演者**（NPCs）和其他玩家互动。思考这一点的其中一种方式是通过因果关系。例如，我们执行特定的动作，如从不同的角色那里偷窃或表现不佳，这反过来又会影响其他NPC如何回应你。一个很好的例子是在游戏《Overlord》中，你越是为了恐吓村庄而做出过激行为，他们就越不愿意帮助你，甚至与你互动。虽然这可能很有趣，但也可能相当令人沮丧，尤其是在你需要完成某些目标而被迫以困难的方式去做时，因为你现在让所有人都讨厌你！因此，记住，为了在游戏中创建AI，你需要定义一个衡量玩家进步的指标，并在开始游戏测试时相应地调整它。
- en: There are many ways that psychology is used in conjunction with AI. For example,
    many websites use Recommendation Systems that either pay attention to what you
    purchase or look at and make suggestions based on that. This can either be done

    lure you back in with "personalized promotions".

- en: 'More specifically talking, the use of psychology in AI can target many other
    areas, such as playing on a character''s (and player''s) emotions. In an era of
    emerging technologies and ways to use them, we find that some games set out to
    make the game feel "real" for the player. The developers try to find ways to cross
    the threshold of reality and game and really encourage the player to make morally
    questionable choices (e.g. Spec Ops: The Line, Heavy Rain), ones of which really
    tug on the heartstrings and make us even reflect on our own behavior.'

    where Dr. Michael Kaufmann—or Dr. K—asks you a range of different questions to
    begin the profiling process. But this is only the basis of the profiling—the profiling

    things you do frequently, or not (e.g. checking your map).

- en: 'In a game, when it comes to player interactions, emotions are one of the most
    useful indicators to a player. A character''s emotions can convey anger, happiness,
    sadness, and frustration, and many games communicate this via complex and detailed
    narrative choices, characters voices, expressions, and overall presence. In many
    ways, emotions can contribute greatly to the atmosphere of a game, let alone their
    influence on how a player interacts, responds, or makes choices within an interaction.
    However, emotions play a more important role than simply conveying an atmosphere.
    They greatly influence the way that we make decisions. For example, a character
    is less likely to think if they haven''t been experiencing a stressful event or
    challenge during gameplay, whereas if they have just narrowly escaped a boss and
    now have to make a fast decision (while a timer is ticking away) about whether
    to shoot a target or not, chances are there will be a very different thought process
    behind it. One of the best examples that I have experienced would be while playing
    Spec Ops: The Line (spoilers ahead). After having spent most of the game killing
    influxes of enemies, you finally reach a level where you have them cornered, but
    they then begin to "flee". Switching to an aerial view via helicopter, you can
    see that they appear to be converging into a corner with no way out. Perfect!
    Right? So, naturally, caught up in the moment, you spam the button to unleash
    fury onto them, trying to destroy every last one. However, that illuminated group
    of people isn''t running. They''re trapped—they''re not fighting back. Well, needless
    to say, after being caught up in the moment to bring down hell onto your enemies,
    you have inadvertently failed your mission—to save the innocents. At this point,
    you''re mentally drained and from here on out, in every dialogue option, you start
    to think more carefully about your choices and how they impact others—more so
    if you hadn''t already.'

  zh: 在游戏中，当涉及到玩家互动时，情感是玩家最有用的指示之一。一个角色的情感可以传达愤怒、快乐、悲伤和挫败感，许多游戏通过复杂和详细的叙事选择、角色声音、表情和整体存在感来传达这一点。在许多方面，情感可以极大地影响游戏氛围，更不用说它们对玩家在互动中如何互动、响应或做出选择的影响了。然而，情感的作用远不止传达氛围那么简单。它们极大地影响了我们的决策方式。例如，如果一个角色在游戏过程中没有经历过压力事件或挑战，那么他们不太可能进行思考；而如果一个角色刚刚险些逃脱一个Boss，现在必须快速做出决定（同时计时器正在倒计时）关于是否射击目标，那么背后的思考过程可能会有很大的不同。我所经历的最佳例子之一是在玩《特种部队：战线》时（前方有剧透）。在花了大部分时间杀敌之后，你终于到达了一个阶段，你可以将他们逼入死角，但他们随后开始“逃跑”。通过直升机切换到空中视角，你可以看到他们似乎正在汇聚到一个没有退路的角落。完美！对吗？所以，自然地，沉浸在那一刻，你不断地按按钮，试图将愤怒倾泻在他们身上，试图摧毁最后一个敌人。然而，那群发光的人并不是在逃跑。他们被困住了——他们没有反击。不用说，在将地狱倾泻在敌人身上的那一刻，你无意中失败了任务——拯救无辜者。在这个时候，你精神上已经筋疲力尽，从现在开始，在每一个对话选项中，你开始更加仔细地思考你的选择以及它们对他人产生的影响——尤其是如果你之前没有这么做的话。

    humans don't always act rationally—we can often be unpredictable. There are so
    many different things that humans consider before making choices (even in games)
    about what to do next. For example, they may take social information, such as
    the rank (status, level, etc.) of a player, into account before deciding to attack
    them. This is most likely to impact the narrative. In addition, players are likely
    to use mental shortcuts in their decision-making, which, depending on their own
    mental models, may lead to all kinds of unpredictable behavior. This can be further
    influenced by the game's environment and previous experiences. Therefore, how
    can you teach a computer to emulate, let alone respond in a believable way?

  zh: 要让一个非人类（AI）的行为看起来像人类，你需要记住人类并不总是理性的——我们常常是不可预测的。在做出选择（甚至在游戏中）关于接下来做什么之前，人类会考虑许多不同的事情。例如，他们可能会在决定攻击玩家之前考虑社会信息，比如玩家的排名（地位、等级等）。这很可能会影响叙事。此外，玩家在决策时可能会使用心理捷径，这取决于他们自己的心理模型，可能会导致各种不可预测的行为。这还可以受到游戏环境和先前经验的影响。因此，你如何教会计算机模仿，更不用说以可信的方式做出反应呢？
- en: Developers need to design AI, and in doing so they also need to consider the
    psychology behind it. For example, should the AI respond to a player the way that
    he/she may be expecting (like that of a normal human being)? Perhaps the developer
    has created a fantasy where conventions exist and therefore the AI must respond
    accordingly (which may be out of the conventions of reality). In all cases, there
    are always points related to the psychology of the player, which the developer
    needs to keep in mind for the design of AI behavior. Therefore, as a developer,
    you need to consider *how* the AI interacts with the game environment in a convincing
    way. You need to make the AI aware of its environment, confine to the game's conventions,
    and respond/behave accordingly. Having the player trigger the AI by walking into
    a collision box to trigger an immediate response is a sure way to break the immersion.
    The AI needs to consider its current situation and be contextually aware.

  zh: 开发者需要设计AI，在这个过程中，他们也需要考虑其背后的心理学。例如，AI是否应该以玩家可能期望的方式（类似于正常人类）回应玩家？也许开发者创造了一个存在惯例的幻想世界，因此AI必须相应地做出反应（这可能超出了现实世界的惯例）。在所有情况下，都始终存在与玩家心理学相关的问题，开发者需要在设计AI行为时牢记这些。因此，作为一名开发者，你需要考虑AI如何以令人信服的方式与游戏环境互动。你需要让AI意识到其环境，遵守游戏规则，并相应地做出反应/行为。让玩家通过走进碰撞盒来触发AI的即时反应是一种破坏沉浸感的方法。AI需要考虑其当前情况，并具有情境意识。
- en: Another consideration is the kinds of relationships that players are likely
    to form with **non-player characters** (**NPCs**). In games where there is a dynamic
    and branching narrative that the player influences, the idea is that you want
    players to feel connected to the game—to the characters within it. Ultimately,
    you want players to "feel" for the other characters and how do you do that, that
    is, with a convincing AI that was developed to connect with the human psyche.
    This can be done in such a way that it begins to feel like an interactive Turing
    test. At this point, you can see that there are at least several ways that you
    can use psychology to influence the design of AI.

  zh: 另一个需要考虑的因素是玩家可能形成的与**非玩家角色**（**NPCs**）之间的关系。在玩家能够影响动态和分支叙事的游戏中，目标是让玩家感受到与游戏以及其中角色的联系。最终，你希望玩家能够“感同身受”其他角色，那么如何做到这一点呢？那就是通过开发出能够与人类心理相连接的令人信服的AI。这可以通过一种方式来实现，即开始感觉像是一个交互式的图灵测试。在这个阶段，你可以看到至少有几种方式你可以利用心理学来影响AI的设计。
- en: In addition to branching narratives, another important aspect is the ability
    to incorporate emotion into the AI's interaction with the player. For example,
    if a player is interacting with different NPCs in a negative way, then this will
    influence the way that the AI will respond. This isn't necessarily in terms of
    narrative, but also in terms of attitude toward the player. For example, an NPC,
    in the beginning, may be willing to help you—perhaps even offer you a discounted
    rate during a trade. However, based on your relationships with other NPCs (e.g.
    negative attitudes), your actions may inevitably influence the attitudes of NPCs
    that you haven't behaved in the same way toward (e.g. those with a previously
    positive attitude toward you).

  zh: 除了分支叙事之外，另一个重要的方面是能够将情感融入人工智能与玩家的互动中。例如，如果一个玩家以负面方式与其他NPC互动，这将会影响人工智能的反应方式。这不仅仅是在叙事方面，还包括对玩家的态度。例如，一个NPC在开始时可能愿意帮助你——也许甚至在你交易时提供折扣。然而，根据你与其他NPC的关系（例如，负面态度），你的行为不可避免地会影响那些你没有以相同方式对待的NPC的态度（例如，那些之前对你有积极态度的人）。
- en: The irony is all of this is that to make AI believable is to make it imperfect.
    Humans are not perfect—we are far from it in many cases—so AI should be as well.
    For example, if an AI is chasing a player—even shooting at them—it doesn't make
    sense for the AI to hit the player with every bullet, just like human players;
    it would be reasonable that the AI misses. It should be a situation where the
    AI *barely* wins/loses. In this way, even if it is, to some level, a false sense
    of security for the player, it makes them feel like he/she is achieving something.
    It far outweighs a "God mode" scenario where the player can destroy everything
    with minimal effort or, in contrast, where he/she struggles to move forward because
    the AI is simply too powerful. Of course, this balance can be influenced depending
    on the difficulty setting that the player has set. By doing this, you're able
    to contribute to the player's immersion, that is, to make the game environment
    believable and that the player is interacting with another "person" rather than
    just a scripted character within a game.

  zh: 这种讽刺之处在于，为了让人工智能看起来可信，就需要让它不完美。人类并不完美——在许多情况下我们离完美还很远——因此人工智能也应该如此。例如，如果一个人工智能正在追逐玩家——甚至射击他们——人工智能每次都能击中玩家，就像人类玩家一样，这是没有意义的；人工智能应该会错过。应该是一种人工智能几乎赢/输的情况。这样，即使在一定程度上给玩家带来了一种虚假的安全感，它也会让他们觉得自己在取得成就。这远远超过了一个“上帝模式”的场景，玩家可以轻易地摧毁一切，或者相反，因为人工智能过于强大，玩家难以前进。当然，这种平衡可以受到玩家设置的难度设置的影响。通过这样做，你能够为玩家的沉浸感做出贡献，也就是说，使游戏环境看起来可信，玩家在与另一个“人”互动，而不是仅仅与游戏中的一个脚本角色互动。
- en: Along the same lines of "believability" is the reaction time of AI. Just as
    much as you don't want to make them more powerful than the abilities that a player
    possesses, they too need to react with the same speed in terms of processing events
    as a player would. For example, players (a.k.a. humans) have an average reaction
    time of 0.2 seconds (vision) and 0.15 seconds (audio) ([www.humanbenchmark.com](http://www.humanbenchmark.com)).
    What this means is that if we were to stand inside of a room, if another person
    was to open the door, it would take us 0.2/0.15 seconds to react to it, whether
    that is to turn our head to see who is at the door or to block the door from opening
    or even hide. Therefore, AI needs to behave the same, albeit handicapped, in terms
    of reaction time in order to avoid having an advantage to that of a human player.
    However, this extends to many other things, such as comprehending an event (e.g.
    was the explosion a bomb or a car backfiring?) and then responding (e.g. look
    for enemies, ignore, investigate). Keep in mind that for each of these types of
    events, the necessary reaction times *and* responses need to be implemented.

  zh: 与“可信度”同样重要的是人工智能的反应时间。正如你不想让他们比玩家拥有的能力更强大一样，他们也需要以与玩家相同的速度处理事件进行反应。例如，玩家（即人类）的平均反应时间为0.2秒（视觉）和0.15秒（听觉）([www.humanbenchmark.com](http://www.humanbenchmark.com))。这意味着如果我们站在一个房间里，如果另一个人打开门，我们需要0.2/0.15秒来对此做出反应，无论是转头去看谁在门口，还是阻止门打开，甚至躲藏起来。因此，人工智能在反应时间上需要表现出同样的行为，尽管有所不便，以避免在人类玩家之上获得优势。然而，这还涉及到许多其他事情，比如理解一个事件（例如，爆炸是炸弹还是汽车回火？）然后做出反应（例如，寻找敌人，忽略，调查）。记住，对于这些类型的事件，必要的反应时间和反应都需要实现。
- en: By using psychology to drive the design of AI, we have a framework that helps
    us create believable narratives, characters, and environments so that we can create
    more immersive game environments. In addition, the consideration of psychology
    doesn't specifically relate to the design of AI—we can build upon this in terms
    of in-game events. For example, NPCs that move around the environment may have
    their own stories, their own "psychology", that drives their movement and even
    their interaction with the player. For example, NPC characters may encounter each
    other, some sort of altercation occurs, and as a result, this impacts the player's
    future interaction with them. This is likely to occur if there are characters
    within the game that the player can interact with and either does (but in a particular
    way) or does not interact with at all, which can influence the AI's interaction
    with the player at later parts within the game experience. Randomization is another
    aspect that can help improve the realness of AI within a game environment. Of
    course, to some extent, NPCs are likely to follow the same path when they walk,
    especially in a situation where there are guards protecting an area. However,
    every now and then, allowing the NPC to deviate on their path, perhaps to go around
    the front of a fountain instead of behind it, can all contribute to the authenticity
    of the environment.

- en: Lastly, before we wrap up this chapter, ***testing*** your AI is essential to
    its success. Just like how human behavior is unpredictable, so can the behavior
    of your AI. This is particularly prevalent when it comes to pathfinding. For example,
    when a player is supposed to follow a path, but should another NPC cross it, or
    even the player, it may result in the AI acting in a strange way. As a result,
    it may break the immersion of the player or worse, disrupt the game mechanics

- en: A practical use of AI for gameplay is the ability to adapt a game's environment
    (and all that it contains) in ways that respond to a player's input. For example,
    if players are constantly failing at a certain part of a level, then the player
    spawns closer to it or the enemies become easier to attack. This process of adapting
    difficulty is known as dynamic difficulty adjustment, and it is great because
    it allow players to progress through a game where some parts are particularly
    more challenging than others. The game Crash Bandicoot is an excellent example
    of a game that implements this mechanic, and allows you to enjoy a challenging
    yet playable game experience.
