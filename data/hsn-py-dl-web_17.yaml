    AI at their core to boost their business growth. It's worth noting here that it
    is not important that your entire product or service is based on any AI technique
    or algorithm; only having AI in a small portion of it or for a specific feature
    is enough to boost your product's usefulness and hence the widespread usage of
    your product by customers. Sometimes, you may not even have AI present in any
    of the product's features, and instead, you might only use it to perform data
    analysis and come up with expected trends to make sure your product conforms to
    the upcoming trends. Let's take a look at what worked for these companies as they

    the market in 2012, it brought with it a term that was beginning to grow in importance
    and scope—artificial intelligence. They converted something as mundane as memorizing
    words and grammar rules into minigames that would respond differently to each
    user. The Duolingo AI took into account the temporal nature of the human mind.
    They formulated research on how quickly a person is likely to forget the words
    he/she has learned. They called this concept half-life regression and used it
    to reinforce the knowledge of the words it predicted that the user would have
    forgotten at any given point of time.

    in the stories of more such companies that transformed their businesses using
    AI and ruled the market space. If you take a look at almost every website you
    visit, they will all use elements of AI and deep learning on them in some way,
    be it in the form of recommendation systems or advertisements (which are again
    promotional recommendation systems). We then covered the upcoming topics in the
    field of deep learning, which are looking for implementation on websites in the
    very near future. It would be amazing if you could come up with a service based
    on any of these topics!

  zh: 在本书的最后一章中，我们尝试激励你构建下一个深度学习项目，并在网络平台上应用它。你可能对更多此类公司如何通过人工智能转型并主导市场的故事感兴趣。如果你仔细看看你访问的几乎每个网站，你会发现它们都以某种方式使用了人工智能和深度学习元素，无论是推荐系统还是广告（广告本质上也是一种推广推荐系统）。随后，我们讨论了深度学习领域即将出现的主题，这些主题在不久的将来将在网站上得到实现。如果你能基于这些主题中的任何一个想出一项服务，那将是非常棒的！
