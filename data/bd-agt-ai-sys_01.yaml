  zh: 生成式AI简介
- en: Generative AI refers to a class of AI technologies that is capable of generating
    various forms of content, including but not limited to text, images, audio, and
    video. These AI systems can generate new content, based on their training data
    and input parameters, which usually include text prompts but can also involve
    other forms of input such as images. The recent buzz around generative AI comes
    from the simplicity with which new user interfaces powered by this AI technology
    can create high-quality text, graphics, and videos in seconds.

  zh: 生成式AI指的是一类能够生成各种形式内容的人工智能技术，包括但不限于文本、图像、音频和视频。这些AI系统可以根据其训练数据和输入参数生成新的内容，通常包括文本提示，但也可能涉及其他形式的输入，如图像。最近围绕生成式AI的炒作源于这种AI技术支持的新用户界面能够以极简的方式在几秒钟内创建高质量的文本、图形和视频。
- en: In very simple terms, generative AI is about making new data that looks like
    the data from which it has been trained. In other words, learning the underlying
    patterns, structures, and distributions of input data enables a procedure within
    the model allowing it to generate new data in a similar way. For instance, if
    trained on a dataset of human faces, a generative AI model will be able to create
    completely new faces of people that don’t actually exist in real life but are
    very realistic. In essence, generative AI models work by learning the probability
    distribution of a dataset and then sampling from that distribution to create new
    instances. This approach is different from discriminative models, whose goal is
    to learn how to tell classes of data apart. For example, a discriminative model
    could be trained to separate pictures of cats and dogs, but a generative model
    would be trained to make up completely new pictures of cats or dogs.

  zh: 用非常简单的术语来说，生成式AI是关于创建看起来像其训练数据的新数据。换句话说，学习输入数据的底层模式、结构和分布，使得模型内部的一个过程能够以类似的方式生成新数据。例如，如果在一个包含人类面部数据集上训练，一个生成式AI模型将能够创建出完全不存在于现实生活中的新面孔，但这些面孔非常逼真。本质上，生成式AI模型通过学习数据集的概率分布，然后从该分布中采样以创建新实例来工作。这种方法与判别模型不同，判别模型的目标是学习如何区分数据类别。例如，一个判别模型可以被训练来区分猫和狗的图片，但一个生成模型则被训练来制作猫或狗的全新图片。
- en: The concept of generative AI goes a long way back; in fact, it dates back to
    the time when machine learning was in its cradle. However, it is only recently
    that this field has come under the limelight due to neural networks and drastic
    improvements in computing power over the last 10 years. In the early attempts
    at generative modeling—Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models—many simpler
    statistical techniques were involved. Methods of modeling arbitrary complex data
    distributions have much higher potential compatibility with the kinds of methods
    that were previously dominant but have recently been overcome by deep learning.
    Deep learning was therefore a watershed development for the field of generative
    AI. Models, such as VAEs, which started appearing around the beginning of the
    2010s, were able to leverage deep neural networks to model more complex data distributions.
    Around that same period, GANs were proposed; for the first time, they offered
    a new way for two neural networks to work together to create data, using principles
    from game theory. In a general sense, these breakthroughs took leaps toward the
    possibilities of making real, high-quality, realistic creation of data.

  zh: 生成式AI的概念可以追溯到很久以前；实际上，它可以追溯到机器学习尚处于摇篮时期的时候。然而，由于神经网络和过去10年计算能力的巨大提升，这个领域最近才受到关注。在早期生成建模尝试中——高斯混合模型和隐马尔可夫模型——涉及了许多简单的统计技术。建模任意复杂数据分布的方法与之前占主导地位但最近被深度学习所超越的方法具有更高的兼容性。因此，深度学习对生成式AI领域来说是一个分水岭的发展。例如，VAEs等模型在2010年代初开始出现，能够利用深度神经网络来建模更复杂的数据分布。在同一个时期，GANs被提出；它们第一次提出了一种让两个神经网络通过博弈论原理共同工作以创建数据的新方法。从一般意义上讲，这些突破在实现真实、高质量、逼真数据创建的可能性方面迈出了巨大的步伐。

    VAE consists of learning a probabilistic mapping between data and a latent space,
    and vice versa. This means learning how to convert real data into a simplified
    representation (such as a compressed form) and then back again into data that
    looks real. VAEs are designed to ensure a high likelihood of the data while preserving
    a well-structured latent space to enable the generation of new data samples similar
    to the training data. Some of the most common flavors of VAE are as follows:'

  zh: 最受欢迎的生成式模型之一是VAE。VAE背后的核心思想是学习数据与潜在空间之间的概率映射，反之亦然。这意味着学习如何将真实数据转换为简化的表示（例如压缩形式），然后再将其转换回看起来真实的数据。VAEs被设计用来确保数据的高可能性，同时保留一个结构良好的潜在空间，以便生成与训练数据相似的新数据样本。以下是一些最常见的VAE变体：
- en: '**VAE** : The basic model that compresses and reconstructs data. It gives a
    framework for generating new samples out of the learned latent space. The VAE
    is a generative model that learns to compress and reconstruct data while also
    learning a probability distribution of the latent space. In simpler terms, a VAE
    is like a clever algorithm that learns to understand and recreate data. Imagine
    it as a skilled artist who can compress a detailed painting into a simple sketch
    (encoding) and then recreate the full painting from that sketch (decoding). What
    makes VAEs special is that they don’t just copy data but also learn the essence
    of it, allowing them to create new, similar data. This is like an artist learning
    not just to copy specific paintings but also to understand the style so well that
    they can paint new, original works in that style. In real life, VAEs have been
    used in many creative ways. For instance, in drug discovery, VAEs have been used
    to generate novel molecular structures. Researchers at AstraZeneca used VAEs to
    explore chemical space and propose new drug-like molecules with desired properties,
    potentially accelerating the drug development process [1].'

- en: '**Beta-VAE** : An extension of VAE that introduces a hyperparameter to control
    explicitly the trade-off between the reconstruction quality and the disentanglement
    of the latent space. The model undertakes the creation of more interpretable disentangled
    representations. In simpler terms, Beta-VAE is like a more flexible version of
    the original VAE. It allows researchers to adjust how much the model focuses on
    recreating exact details versus understanding the underlying features of the data.
    This is similar to teaching an art student to not just copy a painting but also
    to understand and separate the key elements such as color, shape, and style. This
    ability to *disentangle* features makes Beta-VAE particularly useful in fields
    such as computer vision and robotics. For example, researchers have used Beta-VAE
    to teach robots to understand objects better. By learning to separate features
    such as size, color, and position, robots can more easily recognize and manipulate
    objects in different situations, making them more adaptable and efficient in various
    tasks [2].'

    content generation with the generation of game elements such as character design,
    level layouts, music and sound effects, and so on. By providing different conditions

- en: '**Generation of images and videos** : Multimodal generative models (that is,
    LLMs that can handle images, text, audio, and videos) are making it possible to
    generate realistic audio/visuals through various platforms and tools. For example,
    in media and entertainment, generative AI can help in generating visual effects,
    designing avatars, and developing virtual reality content. In the fashion and
    design industry, it is being used to conceptualize new clothing designs, prepare
    virtual fashion shows, and make fashion trend predictions. In marketing ads and

    developers in software development. These models can often generate accurate code
    snippets, or sometimes an entire function based on text prompts. Advanced implementation
    of generative AI in code generation includes plugins created for various **integrated
    development environments** ( **IDEs** ), such as **Visual Studio Code** ( **VS
    Code** ), that can understand the entire context of the code base, identify errors,
    create code documentation, and generate unit test scripts. Another implementation
    of code generation is text-to-query use cases where a natural language prompt
    is converted into a SQL query, which can then be executed against a database to
    get the desired results. However, this is one of the areas where special caution
    must be taken, especially before executing the code generated by an LLM, to prevent
    risks of malicious code execution. Often, in these situations, the code generated
    by the LLM is executed in a sandbox and sanitized to check whether the code is
    safe and appropriate for execution in an autonomous environment.'

- en: '**Autonomous workflows and robotics** : As we briefly discussed earlier, LLM-powered
    AI agents are an advanced implementation of generative AI with LLMs serving as
    their foundations. These agents can perform several tasks in various use cases.
    For example, a travel booking website with a virtual assistant chatbot can implement
    agents to automate the travel and hotel booking process for the customer. In these
    cases, the agent-based system can act on specific tasks using tools (such as calling
    a flight booking API) simply by understanding the context of the conversation
    that the customer is having with the chatbot. More advanced agent-based systems
    often come into play when discussing robotics, where a robot’s actions are primarily
    controlled by agents. The robotic agent essentially determines what decisions
    to make based on its environment or the specific task it is assigned to perform.
    It uses agents to execute actions that an LLM would otherwise be unable to perform;
    for example, an agent can turn on or off the limb actuators of a robot. AI in
    robotics is a novel and open field of research, with numerous innovations emerging
    in the industry, particularly targeted toward manufacturing applications.'

    challenges and limitations. Some of these challenges and limitations need to be

    for any particular use case. Here’s a brief discussion of some of the most common

  zh: 数据质量和偏见
- en: The generative models are largely aided by the quality and diversity of data
    in the training dataset. Any model trained with biased or unrepresentative data
    will reproduce outputs with the same kind of bias, hence solidifying existing
    biases or allowing marginalization of one or several groups in case of bias in
    the training data.

  zh: 生成模型在很大程度上依赖于训练数据集中数据的质量和多样性。任何使用有偏见或不具代表性的数据进行训练的模型都将产生具有相同类型偏见的输出，从而巩固现有的偏见，或者在训练数据存在偏见的情况下，使一个或多个群体边缘化。
- en: 'One way this challenge can be dealt with is by ensuring richness in diversity,
    good quality data, and so on for a wide array of perspectives within the dataset
    itself used for training. As with any machine learning problem, analysis of the
    data and knowing the data distribution across features is often helpful. Data
    analysis can reveal imbalances that can introduce bias in the model. There are
    several algorithmic ways of mitigating bias in training data (for instance, using
    oversampling or undersampling), but each of these methods has its own advantages
    and disadvantages. For example, consider two classes of data in a training dataset
    that contains more instances of *Class 0* data than *Class 1* data, causing a
    natural imbalance in the dataset. When a model is trained with such a dataset,
    the model would “overfit” on the *Class 0* type of data and would become more
    proficient in or even memorize data that belongs to *Class 0* and may not perform
    well for data belonging to *Class 1* This inherently causes the model to perform
    poorly and demonstrate heavy bias. The following figure demonstrates the effect
    of oversampling and undersampling on such a dataset to mitigate bias:'

  zh: 处理这种挑战的一种方法是通过确保数据集本身用于训练的广泛视角中的多样性丰富性、高质量数据等。与任何机器学习问题一样，分析数据和了解数据在特征上的分布通常是有帮助的。数据分析可以揭示可能导致模型偏差的不平衡。有几种算法方法可以减轻训练数据中的偏差（例如，使用过采样或欠采样），但每种方法都有其自身的优缺点。例如，考虑一个训练数据集的两个类别，其中*Class
    0*数据实例比*Class 1*数据实例多，导致数据集自然不平衡。当使用这样的数据集训练模型时，模型会对*Class 0*类型的数据“过度拟合”，并可能更加擅长或甚至记住属于*Class
    0*的数据，而对于属于*Class 1*的数据可能表现不佳。这本质上导致模型表现不佳并显示出严重的偏差。以下图展示了过采样和欠采样对这种数据集的影响，以减轻偏差：

  zh: 数据隐私
- en: Multiple experiments and researchers have proven that LLMs have a propensity
    to leak data they are trained on. This is especially problematic if the models
    are trained on large amounts of private or proprietary information. Special techniques
    and styles of prompting LLMs have shown that it is sufficient to coerce the model
    to generate data that includes verbatim text from its training dataset. These
    prompting techniques are not sophisticated and often make it a very easy, cost-effective
    attack vector to get a model to leak information. For example, as discussed in
    the paper named *Scalable Extraction of Training Data from (Production) Language
    Models* [15], researchers were able to spend only $200 worth of API calls to OpenAI’s
    GPT-3.5 model and use prompt injection techniques to coerce the model to leak
    private information. The leaked information includes people’s names, email and
    physical addresses, and phone numbers that were inadvertently present in the model’s
    training dataset. While some of these issues are actively being addressed by model
    providers such as OpenAI, it can still be problematic for organizations that choose
    to train their own models in-house.

  zh: 多项实验和研究人员已经证明，大型语言模型（LLMs）有泄露它们训练数据的倾向。如果模型是在大量私人或专有信息上训练的，这尤其成问题。对LLMs进行特殊技巧和风格的提示已经表明，迫使模型生成包含其训练数据集中字面文本的数据是足够的。这些提示技术并不复杂，通常使攻击向量变得非常简单、成本效益高，可以迫使模型泄露信息。例如，正如在名为*Scalable
    Extraction of Training Data from (Production) Language Models* [15]的论文中讨论的那样，研究人员能够仅花费价值200美元的API调用费用，使用提示注入技术迫使OpenAI的GPT-3.5模型泄露私人信息。泄露的信息包括人们的姓名、电子邮件和物理地址，以及模型训练数据集中意外出现的电话号码。虽然一些这些问题正在由模型提供商如OpenAI积极解决，但对于选择在内部自行训练模型的组织来说，这仍然可能是个问题。
- en: Some of the common mechanisms to mitigate this is to perform data anonymization
    or pseudonymization on the training data to remove or obscure personal, private,
    and or proprietary information, even before training the model. Both of these
    techniques involved using smaller, cheaper, and faster AI models to perform classification
    and entity detection to identify the presence of personal or private data in the
    training dataset. Once identified, the private information can be obscured, masked,
    or entirely removed from the training dataset. Note that there could be several
    implications to doing this depending on your use case, so special analysis must
    be performed to ensure that it doesn’t impact the model’s performance.

  zh: 一些常见的缓解机制是在训练数据上执行数据匿名化或假名化，以在训练模型之前删除或模糊个人、私人或专有信息。这两种技术都涉及使用更小、更便宜、更快的AI模型来执行分类和实体检测，以识别训练数据集中是否存在个人或私人数据。一旦识别出来，这些私人信息可以被模糊、掩盖或完全从训练数据集中删除。请注意，根据您的用例，这样做可能会有几个影响，因此必须进行特殊分析以确保不会影响模型的表现。

    high computational power; this often makes it economically cost-prohibitive and
    energy-consuming to train large language models. Although there have been several
    hardware breakthroughs that make it possible to train such models, access to these
    hardware assets still remains expensive, privileged, and limited. For example,
    **graphics processing units** ( **GPUs** ), initially designed for rendering high-fidelity
    graphics, have become crucial for AI model training, fine-tuning, and computations.
    NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture, introduced in 2006, allowed GPUs to be used for general-purpose
    computing, and modern GPUs such as NVIDIA’s A100 and H100 have since been specifically
    optimized for AI workloads. However, these high-end GPUs can often cost tens of

- en: Training large models such as GPT-3 is estimated to cost millions of dollars
    in compute resources alone. The exact cost depends on factors such as model size,
    training duration, and hardware efficiency. For example, training GPT-3 was estimated
    to cost around $4–5 million in compute resources, and more recent models such
    as GPT-4 and PaLM are likely even more expensive to train. Beyond the hardware
    itself, there are significant infrastructure costs related to power consumption,
    cooling, and data center space. Due to the high costs, training large language
    models is primarily done by large tech companies or well-funded research institutions.
    Cloud services now offer access to pre-trained models and fine-tuning capabilities,
    making some level of LLM work more accessible to smaller organizations and the
    general public. A way to overcome this challenge can be found in recent innovations
    with **small language models** ( **SLMs** ), which are much smaller generative
    AI models that can be trained to achieve specific tasks. Even though these models
    are limited to a very narrow set of domain-specific tasks, it is much more economical
    to train these models since they require far fewer computational resources.
