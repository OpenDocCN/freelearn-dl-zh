    on evolving existing products that don’t currently use **machine learning** (**ML**)
    to leverage **artificial intelligence** (**AI**). We will refer to these products
    as non-ML native products. In the previous part, we discussed ML native products
    and explored how to go about building an AI native product and how the process
    unfolds in a way that’s optimal from a data, company, and strategy perspective.
    Using this same lens, we will now compare and contrast how this process unfolds
    for products that don’t currently leverage AI.

    industrial revolution. It will serve as a reminder and a blueprint for those of
    us working as entrepreneurs or product managers for products and organizations
    that are ready to fully embrace AI. We will be reinforcing the importance of the
    coming shift towards AI and what it means across industries. For those that are
    already at a place where they can embrace AI, we hope to offer a plan they can
    be confident in as they move forward toward evangelizing AI in their products
    and wider organizations. For those that are still skeptical, we hope it galvanizes
    you and offers a clear vision of what’s to come so that you can start the work
    needed to prepare for such a shift. For those that are anti-AI, we hope to offer
    a glimpse into what a future without AI adoption looks like for your company’s

- en: We like referring to the evolution AI will require of all industries as a *competitive
    imperative* because the language we use to describe this paradigm shift will need
    to be more urgent if it’s going to adequately prepare people for what’s to come.
    Each industry is a universe in and of itself, and once companies within industries
    start to see success with AI adoption, this adoption will accelerate. We've mentioned
    before that product management is an inherently commercial role because, as a
    product manager or leader, you are tasked with the commercial success of your
    product. The competitive edge and marketing splash that can come from promoting
    an AI product is undeniable.

- en: But beyond marketing, AI allows all industries to advance in more tangible ways.
    All economic and social areas will change with AI, from healthcare to tech, to
    education and government. The way industries relate to raw materials, plan, predict,
    and build products will change with this transition to AI adoption. The **World
    Economic Forum** (**WEF**) defines the industrial revolution we’re currently in
    as *“characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between
    the physical, digital, and biological spheres.”* We love this description because
    it places AI and ML firmly in the middle of these spheres. In order to account
    for the physical, we need a way to translate the physical world into data. This
    data could be about anything in the world beyond us, or it could be about our
    own bodies. The collection and processing of this data will inevitably interact
    with AI and ML to some degree in order to be actionable in some way, and once
    this ball gets rolling, we humans, in our infinite creativity and inspiration,
    will come up with new combinations and expressions beyond the use cases we see
    today.

  zh: 除了市场营销，人工智能还使各行各业能够以更具实质性的方式发展。所有经济和社会领域都会因人工智能而发生变化，从医疗保健到技术，再到教育和政府。随着人工智能的应用，行业对原材料的关系、规划、预测和产品构建的方式都会发生变化。**世界经济论坛**（**WEF**）将我们当前所处的工业革命定义为*“由技术融合特征所主导，模糊了物理、数字和生物领域之间的界限。”*我们喜欢这个描述，因为它将人工智能和机器学习明确地置于这些领域的核心。为了考虑到物理世界，我们需要一种将物理世界转化为数据的方式。这些数据可能涉及我们之外的任何事物，或者涉及我们自己的身体。这些数据的收集和处理必然会在某种程度上与人工智能和机器学习进行互动，以便以某种方式成为可操作的，一旦这个进程开始，凭借人类无穷的创造力和灵感，我们将提出超越今天使用案例的新组合和表达方式。
- en: The way our lives are changing in seen and unseen ways affects many technological
    areas, not just AI. We’re currently seeing massive breakthroughs in these areas,
    and the WEF goes on to say, *“the possibilities of billions of people connected
    by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and
    access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied
    by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence,
    robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology,
    biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.”* This
    is at the heart of what makes this such a privilege to witness in our time. There’s
    effectively a technological renaissance happening, and we’re slowly witnessing
    this renaissance unfold in real time every time we read the news, download a white
    paper, or find a study. I'm constantly reminding myself how exciting the current
    technological advancements are when you consider that 10 years ago, I didn’t have

    negative externalities, such as job losses, accompany all this progress. The automation
    of work will replace tasks and jobs that are routine, and almost all jobs have
    some routine to them. This is inevitable. It’s also why some fear the age of AI
    because they’re worried AI will replace their jobs. After all, if a company can
    get done what it needs to be done by automation, by buying a product, or by using
    some form of AI to replace a human worker, then why wouldn’t it? There are people
    who work in operations, procurement, or finance whose entire job is to look for
    ways to save their companies money, and even those people could find their own
    jobs automated! Eventually, the shift will come, and in the meantime, we’ll be

  zh: 即使超出了我们在取得突破的领域之外，所有这些进步也伴随着牺牲、负面外部性，例如工作岗位的流失。工作的自动化将取代那些例行的任务和工作，而几乎所有的工作都有一定的例行性。这是不可避免的。这也是一些人害怕AI时代的原因，因为他们担心AI会取代他们的工作。毕竟，如果一家公司可以通过自动化、购买产品或使用某种形式的AI替代人工来完成所需的工作，那它为什么不这么做呢？一些在运营、采购或财务领域工作的人，他们的工作就是寻找节省公司开支的方法，甚至这些人也可能发现他们自己的工作被自动化了！最终，这一变化将到来，而在此期间，我们将一篇篇地看到相关新闻报道。
- en: But what’s more likely is that AI will be used to assist just about all workers
    with their jobs in some capacity. We don’t mean to minimize the collective loss
    that will arise with AI. There are jobs in data entry and manufacturing that will
    never come back, and you could argue they shouldn’t. After all, who likes data
    entry? Who likes being underpaid at minimum wage, *no- skill* jobs? Even the phrase
    "no-skill" or "low-skill" jobs is degrading, unfair, and often a way for companies
    to defend their unlivable wages. The fact that the US is still debating over a
    reasonable minimum wage after years of studies showing a lag in real wage growth
    is laughable. And yet, AI could make all these debates a moot point by automating
    the very jobs we’re looking to boost with a higher minimum wage. We've heard arguments
    that AI will replace jobs that are unenjoyable, mind-numbing, and oppressive.
    We've also heard arguments that AI will allow humans to capitalize on their curiosity
    and make even more money working jobs that place a premium on their creative,
    complex problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This assumes most people
    want that and don’t want an easy job they can do day in and day out and live a
    peaceful life free of complex thoughts.

  zh: 但更可能的情况是，AI将以某种方式帮助几乎所有工人完成他们的工作。我们并不是要忽视AI带来的集体损失。数据录入和制造业中的一些工作将永远消失，你也可以说它们不应该回来。毕竟，谁喜欢做数据录入？谁喜欢在最低工资下做*无技能*的工作？即便是“无技能”或“低技能”工作这个说法也是贬低性的、不公平的，而且常常成为公司为自己提供无法维持生计的工资辩护的方式。美国至今仍在就合理的最低工资进行辩论，而研究已经表明实际工资增长滞后，这真是令人可笑。然而，AI可能会通过自动化那些我们希望通过提高最低工资来增强的工作，使所有这些辩论变得无关紧要。我们听过这样的论点：AI将取代那些令人不快、单调乏味、压抑的工作。我们也听过这样的论点：AI将使人类能够发挥他们的好奇心，赚取更多的钱，从事那些重视创造性、复杂问题解决和批判性思维技能的工作。这是假设大多数人都想要这样，而不是想要一份可以日复一日轻松做的工作，过着远离复杂思维的平静生活。
- en: Beyond all the doom and gloom, there’s an upside. Many of the jobs people will
    be doing in the future are not yet known. According to a report by Dell and the
    **Institute for the Future** (**IFTF**), 85% of jobs that will exist by 2030 don’t
    exist yet. That’s incredible. What’s perhaps most incredible is that this is all
    being discovered by all of us as time goes on. Just 15 years ago, we’d be confused
    if someone told us they were a social media manager. Even throughout my own career,
    I have seen what was previously called an account manager role shift and morph
    into a more sales-focused account executive role or more performance-focused role
    such as customer success manager. The terms data analyst and data scientist also
    entered the zeitgeist not long ago. The function of both these roles has existed
    for some time, but the formalization of those roles and what they mean at a certain
    point in time is a new development. In the near future, we might be hearing about
    tele-surgeons, data brokers, drone managers, and VR technicians more often than
    we do now.

    the gravity of what you were explaining to them in the first place. It’s important
    to keep an eye on the risks. After all, AI will likely create a greater polarity
    between jobs and widen the gap between earners. Those that are in the know and
    can anticipate the way their jobs will change because of AI can better prepare

    solicit the help of a consultant. Apart from doing your own research within the

    you. You’ll also have to make some decisions about what kind of infrastructure
    you want to have, what the reporting structure will look like for your high-tech
    projects, and where the easiest applications of data or AI projects would be for

    managers that are focused on individual products as product owners. You might
    have product managers that focus on the infrastructure and developer tools side.
    You could be an AI product manager that is more focused on the research side to
    find new innovations to add to your product line. You could also have a role that
    is most focused on the responsible building of AI and focus more on the ethics
    of your product. If you are the only product manager, you’ll have to consider
    all aspects mentioned above and know a bit about everything.

  zh: 根据你的产品组织的成熟度，你可能会有专注于单个产品的产品经理，担任产品负责人的角色。你也可能有专注于基础设施和开发者工具的产品经理。你可能是一名更加专注于研究方面的AI产品经理，寻找可以添加到产品线中的新创新。你还可能担任一个更加注重负责任地构建AI的角色，专注于产品的伦理问题。如果你是唯一的产品经理，那么你需要考虑上述所有方面，并且对每个方面都有一定的了解。
- en: Even the way we see roles defined now will begin to change. At this point in
    time, you might find roles such as AI product manager or ML product manager, which
    articulate the focus on an AI or ML product. Over time, my prediction is that
    this qualifier will start to go away as all product manager roles mature with
    AI adoption. As you’ve seen time and again throughout this book, as with the idea
    that all companies will become AI companies by the end of the decade, the same
    will hold true for product managers. It will likely be that within 10 years, you’ll
    have to have some comfort and familiarity with AI in order to be a product manager
    at all.

  zh: 目前我们看到的角色定义方式也将开始发生变化。在这个时间点，你可能会看到像AI产品经理或机器学习产品经理这样的角色，这些角色明确了专注于AI或机器学习产品的方向。随着时间的推移，我预测随着所有产品经理角色与AI的融合发展，这种限定词将逐渐消失。正如你在本书中反复看到的那样，关于到十年末所有公司都将成为AI公司的观点，产品经理的角色也将如此。十年内，你可能需要对AI有一定的舒适感和熟悉度，才能胜任产品经理的工作。
- en: The last subject we wanted to touch on in this section is the cost associated
    with having an AI program in place for you to research, develop, test, and manage
    your AI activities. As a product manager, you’re not necessarily keeping up with
    the costs and decisions of how to handle this function in your company, but you’ll
    need to be familiar with the costs that go into your product. If you’re actively
    working on developing AI features, this will be one area you’re keeping track
    of as you build products. Part of your work as a product manager is comparing
    the costs of certain feature developments with the potential gains from investing
    in those features. The metrics you choose to demonstrate the value and **return
    on investment** (**ROI**) from the features you’re investing in will make your
    business case.

  zh: 在本节中，我们想要触及的最后一个主题是与实施AI项目相关的成本，包括你用于研究、开发、测试和管理AI活动的成本。作为产品经理，你不一定需要时刻跟踪成本以及如何在公司内部处理这个功能的决策，但你需要熟悉进入你产品的成本。如果你正在积极开发AI功能，这将是你在构建产品时需要跟踪的一个领域。作为产品经理的一部分工作是比较某些功能开发的成本与投资这些功能所带来的潜在收益。你选择的指标来展示投资功能的**投资回报率**（**ROI**）将构成你的商业案例。
- en: AI shouldn’t be a silver bullet. Slapping on an AI tag just for the sake of
    a competitive marketing edge is not a strategy for success because if AI is not
    significantly improving your product and is only included as a vanity feature,
    you’ll eventually find yourself outperformed by products that do leverage AI appropriately.
    Understanding which AI features to expand on and how they’re improving your product
    will make your job as an AI product manager easier and you’ll understand this
    better and better with time. Use your curiosity and experimentation and take intelligent
    risks. Getting clear on how you can best support your company and what the limitations
    and benefits of AI/ML are will set you up for success in prioritizing features
    and planning product strategy. Understanding the potential harms your AI investments
    might contribute downstream will allow you to build credibility both internally
    within your company but also externally within your industry.

  zh: AI不应被视为灵丹妙药。仅仅为了追求竞争市场优势而贴上AI标签并不是成功的策略，因为如果AI并没有显著提升你的产品，仅仅作为一种虚荣功能添加进去，你最终会被那些真正恰当使用AI的产品超越。了解哪些AI功能值得扩展，以及这些功能如何提升你的产品，会使你作为AI产品经理的工作更加轻松，随着时间的推移，你会越来越清楚这一点。发挥你的好奇心和实验精神，敢于冒智能风险。明确你如何最好地支持公司，以及AI/ML的局限性和好处，会帮助你在优先排序功能和规划产品战略时取得成功。理解你的AI投资可能在后续带来的潜在危害，将有助于你在公司内部和行业外部建立信誉。
- en: As an AI product manager, you are creating AI evangelism for your organization.
    A big part of this indirect influence is actually creating awareness and understanding
    the growth, the risks, and the inherent opportunity AI offers not only to your
    product and business but to other stakeholders you work with regularly as well.
    All roles will be impacted by AI with time. You’re just ahead of the curve, in
    a sense, because your role is most intimately connected with AI and its potential
    and you can use this firsthand knowledge to guide your peers through this transformation
    as well.

  zh: 总结
- en: The AI revolution is happening at many levels, and in this chapter, we took
    a look at a few of the major areas of how AI is impacting industries as a whole,
    companies from the inside out, and the role of product managers as well. For the
    companies finding themselves in industries that are now seeing AI transformation,
    the first part of this chapter focused on the various areas of AI adoption across
    industries and how this is affecting the future of work itself. The second part
    of this chapter focused on how AI is transforming companies themselves and how
    you can get started at the organizational level to prepare for AI adoption. The
    third part of this chapter then took these concepts down a level to the product
    manager-level view and the mindset needed from the product's organization to ensure
    AI is adopted within a product in a way that ensures integrity and strength moving
    forward.
