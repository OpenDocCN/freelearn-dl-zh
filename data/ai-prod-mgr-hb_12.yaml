    and navigate the tricky conditions AI will force you to work in requires a special
    set of skills, and those skills are sought by virtually everyone right now. Building
    out established processes and workflows that support the various facets of an
    AI program is a formidable project that can be challenging to scope, much like
    AI projects themselves.

  zh: 构建适合AI的条件既有有形的挑战，也有无形的挑战。有形的挑战包括基础设施、投资，坦率地说，还有技术能力。组建团队并引进能够解决问题、应对AI将迫使你工作在其中的复杂条件的人才，需要一套特殊的技能，而这些技能如今几乎是所有人都在寻找的。构建支持AI项目各个方面的已建立流程和工作流程是一个艰巨的任务，和AI项目本身一样，往往难以明确界定。
- en: The intangible challenges are more cerebral and emotional. In [*Chapter 7*](B18935_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219),
    we discussed the differences between traditional software products and AI-native
    products. If you recall that section, one of the biggest differences lies in the
    uncertainty AI brings. When you have an established team that’s already used to
    a certain level of expectation, it can be difficult to articulate just how much
    AI is going to change things. The uncertainty that comes with AI makes it very
    difficult to communicate the full extent of allocating a budget for teams, purchasing
    software, managing expectations of timelines and costs, and resetting boundaries
    in terms of how teams work with one another.

  zh: 无形的挑战更多的是涉及到思维和情感层面。在[*第七章*](B18935_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219)中，我们讨论了传统软件产品和AI原生产品之间的差异。如果你回想那一部分内容，其中一个最大的不同比在于AI带来的不确定性。当你有一个已经习惯了某种期望水平的成熟团队时，很难清晰地表达AI将会如何改变现状。AI带来的不确定性使得在为团队分配预算、购买软件、管理时间线和成本的期望、以及重新界定团队之间如何协作的边界时，沟通变得非常困难。
- en: You can’t have a fully supported AI program if your internal teams don’t have
    the right infrastructure and procedures in place. You also can’t have it if you
    do have the infrastructure and processes, but your internal teams haven’t emotionally
    internalized them yet. According to Gartner, *“By 2025, the 10% of enterprises
    that establish AI engineering best practices will generate at least three times
    more value from their AI efforts than the 90% of enterprises that do not.”* There’s
    a significant upside for companies that do their due diligence to set up their
    AI programs properly.

  zh: 如果你的内部团队没有合适的基础设施和流程，你无法拥有一个完全支持的AI程序。如果你有了基础设施和流程，但内部团队还没有情感上接受它们，你同样无法拥有一个成功的AI项目。根据Gartner的说法，*“到2025年，建立AI工程最佳实践的10%企业将从他们的AI工作中获得的价值至少是90%企业的三倍。”*
    对于那些认真设立AI项目的公司来说，存在着巨大的潜力。
- en: The work of bridging the gap between the tangible and intangible challenges
    of AI is what’s referred to as AI enablement. In order for a traditional software
    product to transition into an AI product as seamlessly as possible, its leaders
    and product managers need to create a plan to make this transition successful.
    Adopting AI is a massive shift for your organization and the way it builds products.
    It’s a fundamental change to how we expect to build. Building a strong culture
    of AI enablement means that you’re preparing your teams as best as you can for
    what’s to come.

  zh: 缩小AI的有形与无形挑战之间差距的工作，称为AI赋能。为了让传统软件产品尽可能无缝地转型为AI产品，其领导者和产品经理需要制定计划，确保这一转型的成功。采用AI对你的组织以及构建产品的方式来说是一次巨大的变革。这是我们期望的构建方式的根本改变。建立一个强大的AI赋能文化意味着你在尽最大努力为即将到来的变化做好准备。
- en: At its core, AI enablement is really all about the data. Finding a way to most
    efficiently collect, label, and curate large amounts of unstructured data is what
    allows model performance to improve most consistently. Improving that data pipeline,
    keeping it clean, and making sure there is a steady supply of it to be used for
    training purposes is what gives the AI/ML pipeline its capabilities. Making sure
    the right data transformations are happening and the proper level of data quality
    is in place is the ultimate objective of AI enablement. This is because of the
    tremendous reliance AI has on data.

  zh: 从本质上讲，AI赋能的核心就是数据。找到一种高效的方式来收集、标注和整理大量非结构化数据，是提高模型性能的关键。优化数据管道、保持数据的清洁，并确保有稳定的数据供应用于训练，是赋能AI/ML管道的能力所在。确保正确的数据转化发生，并且确保数据质量达标，是AI赋能的最终目标。这是因为AI对数据的依赖巨大。
- en: The best combination of AI enablement or AI readiness will come from having
    strong use cases to support your investment in AI, having strong networks of clean
    data you can leverage to support those use cases, and having a clear governance
    strategy of who can access what and how roles are delineated within your organization
    to demonstrate ownership, control, and safety measures to make sure your AI investment
    is as successful as possible. We will go into these concepts in more depth in
    the next chapter.

  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter was all about trends and insights for AI adoption collected from
    some of the most reputable companies that speak about it. We looked at some of
    their insights and projections for the coming years and decades regarding AI adoption.
    Building an AI-native product is, in many ways, more straightforward than transitioning
    a product from traditional software development to an AI product.

  zh: 本章主要讨论了从一些最具声望的公司收集的关于人工智能（AI）采用的趋势和见解。我们分析了它们对未来几年和几十年内AI采用的见解和预测。建立一个AI原生产品在许多方面比将传统软件开发产品转型为AI产品更为简单直接。
- en: In this chapter, we wanted to set the stage and discuss some of the high-growth
    areas for AI adoption because, for many companies, knowing where to begin is often
    the hardest part. Once you’re in the flow of things, you can better anticipate
    what comes next, but when you’re at the precipice of a major paradigm shift, there’s
    a lot of friction. Going over the growth areas, data, and common use cases and
    setting the stage for AI enablement was an intuitive choice to make sure product
    managers out there are aware of what adopting AI can mean for their product. It’s
    a big responsibility and undertaking, and it should be treated as such.

  zh: 在本章中，我们希望为AI采纳的高增长领域奠定基础，并进行讨论，因为对于许多公司来说，了解从哪里开始往往是最困难的部分。一旦你进入了事物的流程，你可以更好地预测接下来的步骤，但当你站在一个重大范式转变的悬崖边上时，会有很多摩擦。回顾增长领域、数据和常见的使用案例，并为AI赋能奠定基础，这是一个直观的选择，以确保产品经理们意识到采用AI对他们的产品意味着什么。这是一项巨大的责任和任务，应该得到相应的对待。
- en: In the next and final chapter, we will go into a lot of the applied considerations
    of transitioning a product to adopt AI and tangibly what that means for your product
    team or organization.
