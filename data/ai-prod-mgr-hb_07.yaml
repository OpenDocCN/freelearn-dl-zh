    the notion of productizing and what that means for AI outputs in the *Productizing
    AI-powered outputs – how AI product management is different* section. We will
    be expanding on that concept in this chapter by exploring the trials and tribulations
    that may come up when building an AI product. Rather than thinking of AI products
    as traditional software products, it helps to think of them as a service that
    you’re learning to productize. What this refers to is the ability to create a
    consistent workflow that you can rely on to deliver consistent results in the
    way traditional products demand.

    AI/ML products. In the following subsections, we’ll first go over how they’re
    similar, and then we’ll note the differences between the two to give us a well-rounded
    sense of what to expect when you’re product managing an AI/ML product. This will
    help us establish a baseline as well as a deviation from traditional PM work.
    When you’re a PM, you’re often tasked with being the person to maintain an intuition
    about your product and how it will grow and evolve through the process of building
    and shipping the product and working with your engineering team.

  zh: 传统软件产品与AI/ML产品之间有许多不同之处。在以下小节中，我们将首先讨论它们的相似之处，然后指出它们之间的差异，从而帮助我们全面了解在进行AI/ML产品管理时应该期待什么。这将帮助我们建立一个基准，并与传统产品管理工作有所区别。当你是产品经理时，你通常需要保持对产品的直觉，理解它如何在构建、发布产品以及与工程团队合作的过程中不断发展和演变。

    what kinds of customer needs and issues your product can anticipate, as well as
    potential problems that might arise as you start to get into the weeds with building
    and marketing your AI product. Many PMs might not be aware of the demands AI/ML
    products will place on them, and this section is primarily aimed at helping PMs
    build this intuition as they start to navigate the world of AI/ML products.

- en: It’s also important to note that traditional software products and AI products
    are increasingly blurring together. This is because most software companies have
    already started to integrate AI/ML into their existing products or launched AI
    native products. PMs that cover a wide variety of products will want to deepen
    their knowledge of AI/ML as a way to stay competitive within their own fields,
    whether they plan to go deep into AI or not. Understanding the differences between
    traditional software and AI products isn’t so much about comparing two disparate
    groups of products. It’s helpful in this case as well, but this is a macro trend,
    and the biggest reason for understanding the two is to anticipate how all products
    will evolve with AI. Let’s begin by checking out how traditional software products
    are similar to AI.

  zh: 还需要注意的是，传统软件产品和 AI 产品正变得越来越难以区分。这是因为大多数软件公司已经开始将 AI/ML 集成到现有产品中，或者推出了原生的 AI
    产品。覆盖多种产品的产品经理（PM）将希望深入了解 AI/ML，以便在自己的领域保持竞争力，无论他们是否打算深入 AI。如果想了解传统软件和 AI 产品之间的差异，重点不在于比较这两类截然不同的产品，而是要认识到这是一个宏观趋势，理解这两者的主要原因是预测所有产品如何随着
    AI 的发展而演变。我们先来看看传统软件产品是如何与 AI 相似的。

    products, along with the outputs from the AI pipelines that support them, follow

    to ideate, keep track of your work, and stay consistent with some framework or
    schedule. Most software companies these days don’t use waterfall methodology anymore
    and have instead opted to use some version of agile, scrum, or lean methodology.
    This means most software companies are using an iterative and experimental approach
    to building and shipping products. They’re taking large overarching business goals
    and translating those goals into specific tasks that will then amount to deliverables
    by the end of any given sprint. Once they have these deliverables done, they undergo
    a process of evaluation to make sure they meet varying expectations through testing.

  zh: 在传统的软件开发中，你将遵循某种方法论来进行创意构思、跟踪工作进展，并保持与某种框架或计划的一致性。如今，大多数软件公司不再使用瀑布式方法，而是选择了敏捷、Scrum
    或精益方法的某个版本。这意味着大多数软件公司都在采用迭代和实验性的方式来构建和发布产品。它们将宏观的商业目标转化为具体的任务，这些任务将在任何一个 sprint
    结束时形成交付成果。一旦这些交付成果完成，它们会经过评估过程，确保通过测试满足不同的期望。
- en: 'The heart of this approach is agility. When you’re building out features of
    your product over time, you have time to test those features both functionally
    and conceptually. This is an economical way of spending time, energy, and resources
    on a product or a feature to then see how it’s received by your customer base
    and greater market. The agility this offers is what allows tech companies to be
    successful: they are able to make changes and adjustments as they build if they’re
    seeing that their product or feature isn’t resonating with their audience of users.
    This will be true whether or not your product supports AI/ML features.'

    AI/ML 特性，都是成立的。
- en: We’d even go a step beyond this and say AI/ML takes the heart of this agility
    to the next level. Because AI/ML products are consistently building from prior
    manifestations, they’re constantly evolving and adapting to new demands on performance,
    accuracy, or speed. You can’t build an AI product in a vacuum. Over time, AI products
    will have many transformations, and because of this, they’re always in a state
    of being updated or upgraded to meet the expectations of their outputs.

    heavily dealing with your personal data, they are often built as data products
    in the sense that they are leveraging and storing some data about you or the entire
    user base to some degree to make certain determinations. Traditional software
    development will have some feedback loop to a database or be built upon a data
    pipeline of some kind that is passing information back and forth from its UI to
    some centralized (or decentralized) repository of some kind.

  zh: 接下来是数据的相似性。即使某些软件产品并未大量处理你的个人数据，它们通常也被视为数据产品，因为它们在某种程度上利用并存储关于你或整个用户群的数据，以做出某些判断。传统的软件开发通常会有某种反馈循环，连接到数据库，或者建立在某种数据管道之上，将信息从UI传输到某种集中式（或去中心化）存储库中。
- en: This means that software engineers are working with massive volumes of data
    in addition to working with source code. We’ve discussed the data demands AI/ML
    products have at length over the course of this book, but it’s important to note
    that this is inherently true of most software products out there. Software products
    are consistently using and accounting for data, whether or not it’s a “data” or
    an “AI/ML” product. Acquiring this data from your initial customers if you’re
    launching a new product is going to be true whether or not you’re building an
    applied AI product. Now that we have looked at how the two are similar, let’s
    check out what differentiates traditional software products from AI.

    this referred to as *applied AI* in product circles. What this means is applications
    of AI outside of a research setting or lab that are used in the building of tech

    products is in the area of scalability. Because AI is so specific and sensitive
    to the quality and peccadilloes of the training data, you’re likely going to have
    issues with scaling this kind of product because you’re likely to encounter so
    many edge cases that you have to go back to the drawing board or start to create
    cohorts within your user base. This has led to what *AI Forum* ([https://ai-forum.com/opinion/why-commercial-artificial-intelligence-products-do-not-scale/](https://ai-forum.com/opinion/why-commercial-artificial-intelligence-products-do-not-scale/))
    refers to as a **collective AI fatigue** from people that are working directly

  zh: 应用AI产品和传统软件产品之间的一个主要区别是在可扩展性方面。由于AI对训练数据的质量和偏差非常敏感，因此你很可能会遇到扩展这类产品的问题，因为你可能会遇到如此多的边缘情况，以至于你不得不重新开始设计，或者开始在用户群体中创建不同的群体。这导致了*AI论坛*

- en: This issue lies not just in the challenge AI poses with accuracy; indeed, you
    need a lot of data for advanced ML and DL models to work well and give you good
    performance, but you also need those models to be robust enough to work with a
    generalized population of users, situations, contexts, and locations. In traditional
    software products, you might not need this level of granularity to see success,
    but with applied AI products you might get the sense that in a perfect world,
    you might need a highly personalized model for every user or use case.

- en: This sense might not be that far off from an optimal reality. What this also
    means is that AI is particularly sensitive to the idea of edge cases, and the
    threshold for what even constitutes an edge case might be lower for AI products
    compared to their traditional software counterparts. While edge cases impact all
    software products, traditional software companies do have an inherent advantage
    in that they’re iterative, so once you build and ship a product, you’re able to
    sell it to virtually all your customers without having to do a lot of customization.

  zh: 这种感觉可能并不远离理想的现实。这也意味着AI特别敏感于边缘情况的概念，甚至定义边缘情况的阈值，可能比传统软件产品的阈值要低。虽然边缘情况会影响所有软件产品，但传统软件公司具有固有的优势，因为它们是迭代的，所以一旦构建并发布产品，你就可以将其销售给几乎所有客户，而不需要做太多定制化。
- en: We will go over the differences in business models later on in this chapter,
    but this issue of scalability is doubly affected by your choice of business model.
    For instance, if you’re a B2B company, your AI product might behave wildly differently
    when compared to other customers because their training data differences might
    be too great. If we contrast this with a B2C company, you might be training your
    models on really representative and diverse data, but then the way your individual
    consumers interact with your product might vary wildly.

    build. Even the issue of agreeing on an acceptable level of product performance
    will likely be time, cost, and energy inefficient, let alone actually acquiring

    in your product enough to consistently use it will require a lot of initial work,

    the process of acquiring and keeping your customers may stay at a consistently
    grueling pace, which further contributes to this issue of scalability up to a
    certain point. Strides are being made, however, to build and discover ways to

    costs. Consent from data owners (e.g. patients) is needed to use their private

    the best example we were able to find came from *Harvard Business Review* ([https://hbr.org/2022/03/how-to-scale-ai-in-your-organization](https://hbr.org/2022/03/how-to-scale-ai-in-your-organization)),
    which mentioned “*…one financial company lost $20,000 in 10 minutes because one
    of its machine learning models began to misbehave. With no visibility into the
    root issue — and no way to even identify which of its models was malfunctioning
    — the company was left with no choice but to pull the plug. All models were rolled
    back to much earlier iterations, which severely degraded performance and erased
    weeks of effort.*” Imagine losing that much money in such a short time and still
    not being able to know where the problem was!

    the area where we see the fastest return on applied AI is when it supports customer
    behavior, which makes sense because it directly impacts sales and is one of the
    highest revenue drivers. This would be use cases of applied AI such as product
    recommendations, scaled pricing algorithms, or advertising personalization/optimization

    more products based on their specific spending and purchasing habits, cost consciousness,

    to the work of product management. With traditional software products, the deterministic
    qualities of a product are hardcoded. Algorithms still exist, but they’re not
    improving or learning over time. They are static. With AI products, these qualities
    are more fluid. There’s a level of expectation setting and performance that has
    to be agreed upon, expressly or intuitively, by the builders and users. If that
    level of performance doesn’t happen because the models aren’t trained enough,
    they have to be trained more. If performance doesn’t come no matter how much training
    you throw at it, you might not have a product to sell at the end of the day! This
    level of uncertainty is cushioned in traditional software because your performance
    goals aren’t quite the moving target they are when you’re building an AI product.

  zh: 最后一个大的区别是概念上的。人工智能给产品管理工作引入了大量的不确定性。在传统软件产品中，产品的确定性特征是硬编码的。算法仍然存在，但它们不会随着时间的推移而改进或学习。它们是静态的。而在人工智能产品中，这些特性则更加灵活。开发者和用户必须明确或直觉地达成一致，设定一个期望的性能水平。如果这个性能水平因为模型训练不足而没有达到，那么模型就需要更多的训练。如果无论投入多少训练，性能依然没有提升，你可能到最后连产品都没有！在传统软件中，这种不确定性得到了缓解，因为你的性能目标不像在构建人工智能产品时那样是一个不断变化的靶子。
- en: Where ML is concerned, you’re bound to have some level of error because, as
    we know, no model is going to be perfect. You will always need more data to get
    better performance. Collectively with your leadership, customers, and engineering
    team, you will come to understand where the threshold of accuracy needs to lie.
    It will be different for every product and every use case. The output from one
    model based on a certain training dataset might be great one day, but if you diversify
    the training set and retrain, it’s probable you won’t get the results you’re expecting.
    It’s very hard to exactly recreate and test these products, and keeping an experimental
    attitude when it comes to managing how you are testing, deploying, and maintaining
    versions will be essential. It’s also hard to know whether your models will most

    some eyebrows. Yes, indeed: AI products are even more difficult to forecast! Finding
    the right balance of factors might take days, weeks, or months. With AI, it might
    not be until you’re well within the weeds of building that you start to grasp
    the complexity of your scope. This poses a great challenge to your leadership

    With B2C products, we see a focus on experimentation because rather than tapping
    into a business need that already exists, these products are looking to tap into

    B2B products, the pressure to keep these consumers charmed is constant because
    they can leave at any point. This puts pressure on product, leadership, and development

    B2B 产品那样的长期合同，维持消费者的吸引力变得至关重要，因为他们可以随时离开。这对产品、领导层和开发团队施加了压力，要求他们不断为客户提供留存的理由，让消费者选择他们。

    in understanding their customer lifetime value and customer acquisition costs
    and tracking those metrics is an important part of staying profitable and sustainable
    in the B2C landscape. B2C offers PMs an easy outlet for applying AI/ML toward
    the acquisition and retention of customers since they have such few touchpoints
    with the end users of their product. PMs in the consumer space also need to hone
    in on the demographic and individualistic qualities of their consumers to better
    understand what to build. If you see that it’s mostly people within a geographic
    area, gender, generation, or subgenre that appeals most to your product, you might
    start to build future features and releases in your roadmap with them in mind.

    you want to leverage AI/ML in ways that will impact your product most obviously
    for it to be worth the top-heavy investment it requires. This is doubly true for
    B2C products because you’re building and using AI to deliver something that saves
    your consumers money or delights them, as well as using the data your product
    produces to decide on how to pivot your product. B2C PMs are reliant on data and
    analytics to make global decisions about their products on a regular basis. Although
    this is changing for the most part, traditionally in the B2B space, your marketing
    efforts are most oriented toward your buyers because they’re the ultimate decision-makers.

    By far the greatest pressure this places on AI/ML consumer products is the pressure
    to perform well, maintain their enormous user base, and keep their consumers happy.
    This means that consumers want to use an app that does what it says it’s going
    to do in a way that’s visually appealing. Because they aren’t as concerned with
    the downstream risks of using your product as B2B customers are, consumers don’t
    particularly care why it’s working, just that it does work. This means that the

    the productizing functionally happens. Taking a service and splitting that service
    apart into smaller pieces that are managed and standardized into reproducible
    and regulated segments is the work of “productizing,’’ and in that vein, MLOps

    data scientists and ML and DL engineers that will be tasked with making adjustments
    to the hyperparameters of your model builds, testing those models, and retraining

    the data, MLOps team members also traditionally do software testing such as code
    tests, unit testing, and integration testing. In many cases, your AI products
    will effectively be traditional software products that incorporate AI/ML features
    in a subset of a greater ecosystem that’s in line with traditional software development.

    in earlier chapters of this book, but we’d like to reiterate here that this is
    a risk that can sneak up on you. Model degradation can happen for a number of
    reasons. Perhaps there are differences between assumptions that are made with
    the data in training and in production. Perhaps there’s been a change to the data
    itself. Perhaps there are unseen biases in your training data that were never
    picked up on. Whatever the reason, continuous monitoring of models in production
    by MLOps will be your best defense in picking up on these nuances and changes

    mirrored in DevOps, which is common to traditional software development. The main
    differences are that in MLOps, CI isn’t just about testing and validating code—it’s
    also about validating and testing the models, data schemas, and the data samples
    themselves. Another difference is that CD isn’t just about deploying a software
    package but about nurturing an automated ML pipeline deployment process that’s
    optimized for deploying the model prediction service or for automatically scaling
    back to an earlier version if there is trouble ahead. Finally, CT isn’t just about
    testing software packages themselves but about retraining and testing the models

- en: The act of productizing involves taking a concept, a service, or a piece of
    technology and developing it into a commercial product that’s suitable for the
    customers you’re looking to attract. As we’ve seen throughout this chapter, this
    work isn’t just a matter of getting your product up and running and creating a
    landing page for your potential customers to magically find. Productizing involves
    critically understanding the business model you’re working in and the ultimate
    audience you’re building for. Remember that AI products can be thought of as AI/ML
    services that are being built into traditional software products. This means that
    another big part of productizing for AI products involves the standardization
    and ritualization of the AI/ML service in a way that’s repeatable and predictable
    for the internal operations teams as well as the customers that will come to rely
    on your product.

    enough. Depending on the specifics of the market you’re serving, you might have
    to customize your product even further for specific use cases, verticals, customer
    segments, and other peer groups. Because AI/ML model performance is so dependent
