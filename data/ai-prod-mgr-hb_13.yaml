    AI adoption in existing products. Every product will be different and every product
    owner will come to their own conclusions about what level of AI adoption to infuse
    into their product. For some products, something as simple as adding one AI feature
    is enough. For other products, a fundamental change to the underlying logic that
    powers your product might be required. The decisions of how to transform your
    product should, first and foremost, be determined by your product strategy and
    should serve your overarching company vision. These decisions should be collaborative
    and should come with a high level of executive sponsorship.

    how to evaluate your product’s performance within the competitive landscape, how
    to build a product strategy that sets you up for success, and ultimately which
    signposts and milestones will help you build confidence and which will indicate
    that you need to go back to the drawing board.

    their product, getting it ready for testing, and releasing it to their customers,
    they need to get really clear on the strategy of how they will position their
    product. This is the thought process behind the Venn diagram exercise we saw in

    can approach potential AI embellishments, we can add one more layer of scrutiny
    to this list. This additional layer focuses on the data, which is what will power
    every single item on these lists. Once product managers begin the work of understanding
    what they can do with the data sources they have and which data sources they’ll
    need to make the items on their list a reality, we’re getting close to actually

    in AI transformation, as well as markers for success. We will call them red flags
    and green flags and they’re signals you can pick up on as you go through this
    process of getting your product ready for AI adoption. Some of these will be concrete
    actions or results and some will be more emotional, but either way, you can use
    them as markers to know whether you’re on the right path or whether you’re hitting
    potential rough patches. In the following subsections, we’ll address a few red
    and green flags. Let’s get started.

    there is an issue with a process we’re setting forth. Because AI adoption is such
    a revolutionary undertaking for any company to take on, it’s best to look out
    for some of these habitual patterns early so that you’re starting on the right

  zh: 红旗是我们可以留意的一些行为模式，这些模式表明我们设定的过程存在问题。因为AI的采纳对于任何公司来说都是一项革命性的工作，所以最好早期就能发现一些这样的惯常模式，以确保你从一开始就能走对方向：
- en: '**I don’t know**: If you’re regularly engaging with various teammates or employees
    on different teams at your company and they seem confused about why the company
    is adopting AI, what the value will be for their customers or readers, and what
    the product’s high-level goals are, that’s a red flag. The point of crafting a
    product strategy that aligns with the move to embrace AI is to make sure no one
    in your organization is confused about why this is happening. Make sure the entire
    company knows why you’re adopting AI and which use cases you’re trying to solve
    with it.'

  zh: '**我不知道**：如果你经常与公司里不同团队的成员或员工互动，而他们似乎对公司为何要采用AI感到困惑，不明白这对他们的客户或读者有什么价值，也不清楚产品的高层次目标是什么，那就是一个红旗。制定一个与AI采纳相符的产品战略的关键是确保公司内没有人对这项变革感到困惑。确保整个公司都了解为何要采用AI，并且清楚你们希望通过它解决哪些具体问题。'
- en: '**Communication stalls**: If you’re not meeting regularly or there’s a lack
    of engagement in your recurring product meetings, there’s likely some internal
    resistance you have to deal with. Do your best to communicate the exciting opportunity
    that embracing AI is, not just in terms of your product but the market as a whole.
    Rather than seeing AI transformation as a burden that’s going to be a lot of work,
    you’ll know you’re on the right path when you can sense curiosity and openness
    from the stakeholders that hold leadership positions at the organization they
    serve. A lack of executive engagement is a critical red flag. AI isn’t something
    leadership can outsource. They need to be involved and engaged at every stage
    of your AI adoption journey.'

  zh: '**沟通停滞**：如果你没有定期开会，或者在定期的产品会议中缺乏参与度，可能存在一些需要处理的内部阻力。尽量传达出拥抱AI所带来的激动人心的机会，不仅仅是从你的产品角度出发，而是从整个市场的角度来看。当你能够感受到公司高层领导的好奇心和开放态度时，你就会知道自己走在正确的道路上，而不是把AI转型视为一个繁重的负担。高层管理层参与度不足是一个重要的红旗。AI不是领导层可以外包的事务，他们需要在你整个AI采纳过程中，参与其中、并保持积极的互动。'
- en: '**You’re not seeing progress**: If you’ve started the process of working on
    creating your AI/ML pipeline and you don’t see progress or at least some early
    positive signals from the model training you’re starting, you might not have the
    right skill level to truly tackle the undertaking that is AI transformation. Making
    sure you have the right talent team, tech stack, and know-how is hard to do at
    the onset, and many companies struggle with establishing the right combination
    of factors as they get started with this. If you are struggling for talent, consider
    working with AI consultancies that can help you leverage from a diverse talent
    pool that’s had exposure to use cases similar to yours.'

- en: '**Your pilot project fails**: It was probably going to anyway. We’ve talked
    so much about managing expectations and this is really what it’s all about. Whether
    you’re balancing your own reaction or the reactions of others in the face of lackluster
    performance or no performance at all, you’re going to have to act as a source
    of faith for yourself and others. ML works and companies all over the world use
    it constructively and productively every day. Those with the patience and determination
    to see it through will be rewarded, but it can be hard to see progress, particularly
    at the beginning and when you’re starting from the perspective of a traditional
    software product. Give it time and don’t give up.'

- en: '**Too much feedback**: Whether from your customers, prospects, users, or internal
    teams, if you find yourself inundated with feedback about what should make it
    to the roadmap and what shouldn’t, take it as a sign that you’ve succeeded in
    properly evangelizing your product vision, goals, and roadmap. When it comes to
    AI transformation, having more voices involved early on can be exhausting, but
    it’s also an amazing indication that people are engaged. It’s a good problem to

- en: '**Reimagining data consumption**: If your internal teams are changing how they
    use and ingest data, that means the culture is changing toward becoming more data-driven,
    which will further support the success of your AI platform. If your organization
    realizes they have to massively overhaul how they annotate, store, collect, and

    that’s created with AI initially. Once you do make the jump to fully embracing
    AI in your own product, you can refer to *Part 2* of this book, which is more
    focused on the aspects that come up when you’re in the flow of building AI. In

    bringing in your stakeholders to make a plan for how to build the transition are

    easier said than done and each section of this chapter will be a process in and
    of itself, but once you are able to get to the point where you’ve decided on a

    were able to be of service in such a big step for their organizations and their
