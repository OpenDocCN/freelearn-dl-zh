    across **verticals**, **customers**, and **customer peer groups**. The purpose
    of this analysis is to understand how you can start to think of product management’s
    role in orienting **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) products for specialized
    groups and, ultimately, what AI allows you to do for those groups. **AI** and
    **machine learning** (**ML**) are powerful tools but have a general power that
    needs to be applied specifically in order for their value to be fully understood.
    In many ways, the work of a **product manager** (**PM**) is to make that value
    as obvious as possible to everyone, from customers to developers.

  zh: 在这一章节中，我们将了解产品如何在**垂直行业**、**客户**和**客户同行群体**之间演化和细分。分析的目的是帮助你理解产品管理如何在为特定群体定向**人工智能**（**AI**）产品时发挥作用，最终，AI为这些群体带来了什么价值。**AI**和**机器学习**（**ML**）是强大的工具，但它们有着普遍的力量，需要在特定应用场景中加以应用，才能使其价值得到完全体现。在很多方面，**产品经理**（**PM**）的工作就是让这种价值尽可能显而易见，从客户到开发人员。
- en: The role of a PM incorporates a lot; it’s multifaceted by nature. You’re involved
    with designing the product, organizing the workflow as that product evolves, analyzing
    feedback from your customers, incorporating that feedback into your overarching
    business goals, researching new methods and improvements, building the greater
    product strategy that aligns with your company’s strategy, and, ultimately, communicating
    across all levels to all your stakeholders, developers, and leaders. This requires
    a lot of understanding, intimacy, and commitment to your product and its success!

    your acceptance criteria and key metrics are concerned. You’ll also want to have

    as an AI PM. This area is, in many ways, a prerequisite to being able to start
    your AI PM career. As an AI PM, you’ll be working with data heavily. Critical
    thinking and complex problem-solving will be necessary to build a successful product

    easy-to-detect patterns in the customer data. There’s also likely to be a rules-based
    system that’s used to mine as it’s scouring the data and looking for anomalies.
    On top of this, there are likely unsupervised ML models used to look for patterns
    beyond the mining and to group activities into clusters to be analyzed later,

    sources of AI/ML adoption that we see most regularly because of the persistence
    and sophistication of cyber criminals. The nature of cybersecurity is ever-changing,
    which means that, over time, companies need to keep step with their potential
    adversaries. It feels like we hear about a new data leak every day, and perhaps
    the most alarming part of cybersecurity is the number of attacks you *don’t* hear
    about.

    detection. In cybersecurity, this established baseline and deviation from it are
    what create the use case of anomaly detection. Once there’s been an anomaly and
    an action is required from the system, we can then move toward rectifying it somehow.
    Often, cyber attacks come from within networks and have clever ways of hiding
    their tracks, but with advanced pattern recognition that’s used for anomaly detection,
    AI systems can see when some actor/user is behaving in ways that don’t make sense
    for a normal user.

    系统能够发现某个行为者/用户的行为不符合正常用户的模式。

    pooling all your users’ actions and subsequent data that is generated from those
    actions on a daily basis. Once all this data is centralized and analyzed, it’s
    able to offer you profound insights by giving you a baseline for not just individual
    users but for all your users all at once as well. This makes things such as finding
    anomalies or new patterns, no matter what the change is, easier because you can
    establish triggers or actions that alert your user or your internal workforce
    when something that requires attention has happened.
