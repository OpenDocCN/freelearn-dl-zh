    were excited by AlphaGo; but why did this news got so much attention? For another
    board game example, in a chess match, Deep Blue, which was developed by IBM, beat
    the world chess champion in 1997\. Of course, it became big news at that time,
    as this was also a moment when a machine beat a human. Why then, when this was
    not the first time a machine had beaten a human, was news of AlphaGo''s triumph
    against Lee SeDol so world-shaking? What is the difference between Chess and Go?
    Well, the difference is in the complexity of the patterns of Go. In fact, Go has
    many more strategy patterns than Chess. In popular board games such as Chess,
    Shogi, and Go, the numbers of patterns to determine who wins or loses are as follows:'

  zh: 这不仅令人工智能研究者激动，也令整个世界兴奋的时刻，但为什么这则新闻会如此受关注呢？举个例子，1997年，国际商业机器公司开发的深蓝在国际象棋比赛中击败了世界冠军。当然，那时也成为重大新闻，因为这也是机器击败人类的时刻。那么，当这并非机器首次击败人类时，AlphaGo击败李世石的胜利为何如此震撼世界呢？国际象棋和围棋有什么不同呢？嗯，区别在于围棋的棋型复杂性。事实上，围棋的策略模式比国际象棋多得多。在流行的棋类游戏如国际象棋、将棋和围棋中，用于决定胜负的模式数量如下：

  zh: 围棋：10,360
- en: Even looking at the numbers, you can see how complicated the strategy of Go
    is and easily imagine that a machine also needs an enormous amount of calculation.
    Because of this huge number of patterns, until recently, people thought it was
    impossible for AlphaGo to beat a human, or that it would be 100 years or 200 years
    before AlphaGo would beat a human. It was considered impossible for a machine
    to calculate the patterns of Go within a realistic time. But now, in a matter
    of a few years, a machine has beaten a human. According to the Google research
    blog, 1.5 months before the DeepMind Challenge Match was held, DeepMind could
    predict the human's moves 57% of the time ([http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html](http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html)).
    The fact that a machine won against a human definitely had an impact, but the
    fact that a machine could learn the strategy of Go within a realistic time was
    even more surprising. DeepMind applies deep neural networks with the combination
    of Monte Carlo tree search and reinforcement learning, which shows the width of
    the application range for the algorithm of deep neural networks.

  zh: 甚至看着这些数字，你就可以看出围棋的策略是多么复杂，很容易想象机器也需要大量的计算。由于这巨大数量的棋型，直到最近，人们认为AlphaGo在现实时间内击败人类是不可能的，或者说要等100年或200年AlphaGo才会击败人类。人们认为机器在现实时间内计算围棋的棋型是不可能的。但是现在，在短短几年内，机器已经击败了人类。根据Google研究博客，在DeepMind挑战赛之前的1.5个月内，DeepMind能够预测人类的棋步57%的时间（[http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html](http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html)）。机器战胜人类的事实确实产生了影响，但机器能够在现实时间内学习围棋策略的事实更为令人惊讶。DeepMind应用了深度神经网络与蒙特卡洛树搜索和强化学习的组合，显示了深度神经网络算法的应用广度。

    had a boost. You might notice that you hear the words "deep learning" in the media
    more often recently. It can be said that the world's expectations of AI have been
    increased that much. What is interesting is that the term "deep learning," which
    was originally a technical term, is now used commonly in daily news. You can see
    that the image of the term **AI** has been changing. Probably, until just a few
    years ago, if people heard about AI, many of them would have imagined an actual
    robot, but how about now? 'The term AI is now often used—not particularly consciously—with
    regard to software or applications, and is accepted as commonplace. This is nothing
    but an indication that the world has started to understand AI, which has been
    developed for research, correctly. If a technology is taken in the wrong direction,
    it generates repulsion, or some people start to develop the technology incorrectly;
    however, it seems that this boom in AI technology is going in a good direction
    so far.

  zh: 自从AlphaGo的新闻被媒体报道以来，AI热潮无疑得到了推动。你可能会注意到，最近在媒体上听到“深度学习”这个词的频率更高了。这可以说是全球对AI的期望已大大提高。值得注意的是，原本是技术术语的“深度学习”如今在日常新闻中被广泛使用。你可以看到**AI**这一词的形象正在发生变化。可能就在几年前，如果人们听到AI这个词，许多人会联想到一个实际的机器人，但现在呢？“AI”这个词现在经常被使用——而且不特别有意识地——与软件或应用程序相关，已被视为司空见惯。这无非是表明，世界已经开始正确理解为研究而发展的AI。如果一项技术走错方向，就会产生排斥，或者有人开始错误地开发技术；然而，似乎目前这股AI技术热潮正朝着一个良好的方向发展。
- en: While we are excited about the development of AI, as a matter of course, some
    people feel certain fears or anxieties. It's easy to imagine that some people
    might think the world where machines dominate humans, like in sci-fi movies or
    novels, is coming sooner or later, especially after AlphaGo won over Lee SeDol
    in the Go world, where it was said to be impossible for a machine to beat a human;
    the number of people who feel anxious might increase. However, although the news
    that a machine has beaten a human could be taken as a negative if you just focus
    on the fact that "a machine won," this is definitely not negative news. Rather,
    it is great news for humankind. Why? Here are two reasons.
  id: totrans-24

  zh: 尽管我们对人工智能的发展感到兴奋，但不可避免地，一些人会感到某些恐惧或焦虑。很容易想象，有些人可能认为机器主导人类的世界，像科幻电影或小说中的情节那样，迟早会到来，特别是在AlphaGo战胜李世石后，曾经被认为机器不可能战胜人类的围棋世界，感到焦虑的人可能会增加。然而，尽管一则“机器战胜人类”的新闻，如果单纯关注“机器获胜”这一事实，可能会被认为是负面的，但这绝对不是负面新闻。相反，这是对人类的重大好消息。为什么？这里有两个原因。
- en: The first reason is that the Google DeepMind Challenge Match was a match in
    which the human was handicapped. Not only for Go, but also for card games or sports
    games, we usually do research about what tactics the opponents will use before
    a match, building our own strategy by studying opponents' action patterns. DeepMind,
    of course, has studied professional Go players' tactics and how to play, whereas
    humans couldn't study enough about how a machine plays, as DeepMind continued
    studying and kept changing its action patterns until the last minutes before the
    Google DeepMind Challenge Match. Therefore, it can be said that there was an information
    bias or handicap. It was great that Lee SeDol won one match with these handicaps.
    Also, it indicates that AI will develop further.
  id: totrans-25

  zh: 第一个原因是，Google DeepMind挑战赛是一场人类处于不利局面的比赛。不仅仅是围棋，卡牌游戏或体育比赛中，我们通常会在比赛前研究对手可能使用的策略，基于对手的行动模式来制定我们的策略。当然，DeepMind研究了职业围棋选手的策略和玩法，而人类却无法充分研究机器的玩法，因为DeepMind在Google
    DeepMind挑战赛前的最后时刻一直在学习和不断变化其行动模式。因此，可以说存在信息偏差或不利条件。李世石在这些不利条件下赢得一局是非常了不起的。同时，这也表明AI将进一步发展。
- en: The other reason is that we have found that a machine is not likely to destroy
    the value of humans, but instead to promote humans' further growth. In the Google
    DeepMind Challenge Match, a machine used a strategy which a human had not used
    before. This fact was a huge surprise to us, but at the same time, it meant that
    we found a new thing which humans need to study. Deep learning is obviously a
    great technology, but we shouldn't forget that neural networks involve an algorithm
    which imitates the structure of a human brain. In other words, its fundamentals
    are the same as a human's patterns of thinking. A machine can find out an oversight
    of patterns which the human brain can't calculate by just adding the speed of
    calculation. AlphaGo can play a game against AlphaGo using the input study data,
    and learns from the result of that game too. Unlike a human, a machine can proceed
    to study for 24 hours, so it can gain new patterns rapidly. Then, a whole new
    pattern will be found by a machine during that process, which can be used for
    humans to study Go further. By studying a new strategy which wouldn't been found
    just by a human, our Go world will expand and we can enjoy Go even more. Needless
    to say, it is not only machines that learn, but also humans. In various fields,
    a machine will discover new things which a human hasn't ever noticed, and every
    time humans face that new discovery, they too advance.

  zh: 另一个原因是我们发现，机器不太可能摧毁人类的价值，反而有助于推动人类的进一步发展。在Google DeepMind挑战赛中，一台机器使用了人类以前从未使用过的策略。这一事实让我们感到非常惊讶，但同时也意味着我们发现了一项人类需要研究的新事物。深度学习显然是一项伟大的技术，但我们不应忘记，神经网络涉及模仿人脑结构的算法。换句话说，它的基础与人类的思维模式相同。通过仅仅增加计算速度，机器能够发现人脑无法计算的模式遗漏。AlphaGo可以与AlphaGo进行对局，并从这场对局的结果中学习。与人类不同，机器可以24小时不断地进行学习，因此它能够快速发现新的模式。在这个过程中，机器会发现一个全新的模式，这可以供人类进一步研究围棋。通过研究人类无法发现的新策略，我们的围棋世界将得到扩展，我们也能更加享受围棋。无需多言，不仅是机器在学习，人类也在学习。在各个领域，机器会发现一些人类之前没有注意到的新事物，每次人类面对这些新发现时，他们也在进步。
- en: AI and humans are in a complementary relationship. To reiterate, a machine is
    good at calculating huge numbers of patterns and finding out a pattern which hasn't
    been discovered yet. This is way beyond human capability. On the other hand, AI
    can't create a new idea from a completely new concept, at least for now. On the
    contrary, this is the area where humans excel. A machine can judge things only
    within given knowledge. For example, if AI is only given many kinds of dog images
    as input data, it can answer what kind of dog it is, but if it's a cat, then AI
    would try its best to answer the kind of dog, using its knowledge of dogs.

  zh: AI和人类处于一种互补的关系中。再重复一遍，机器擅长计算大量的模式，并发现尚未被发现的模式，这超出了人类的能力。另一方面，AI目前无法从完全新的概念中创造出新想法。相反，这恰恰是人类擅长的领域。机器只能在给定的知识范围内进行判断。例如，如果AI仅仅接收到许多种狗的图像作为输入数据，它可以判断这是什么种类的狗，但如果是猫，AI就会尽最大努力根据自己对狗的知识来判断它是什么种类的狗。
- en: 'AI is actually an innocent existence in a way, and it just gives the most likely
    answer from its gained knowledge. Thinking what knowledge should be given for
    AI to make progress is a human''s task. If you give new knowledge, again AI will
    calculate the most likely answer from the given knowledge with quite a fast pace.
    People also have different interests or knowledge depending on the environment
    in which they grow up, which is the same for AI. Meaning, what kind of *personality*
    the AI has or whether the AI becomes good or evil for humans depends on the person/people
    the AI has contact with. One such typical example, in which AI was grown in the
    wrong way, is the AI developed by Microsoft called Tay (`https://www.tay.ai`).

    Tay（`https://www.tay.ai`）。2016年3月23日，Tay在Twitter上发布了以下推文：*hellooooooo world!!!*

    CNN. It was introduced in the project open to the public online at [http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/](http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/)
    or in the dissertation at [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511v1.pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511v1.pdf).
    The idea is to color gray-scale images automatically. If you have any colored
    images – these should be obtained very easily – you can generate grayscale images
    just by writing quick scripts. With that, you have now prepared input data and
    output data for training. Being able to prepare lots of data means you can test
    easier and get high precision more often. The following is one of the examples
    of the tests:'

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we went from the example of AlphaGo as breaking news to the
    consideration of how deep learning will or should develop. A machine winning over
    a human in some areas is not worthy of fear, but is an opportunity for humans
    to grow as well. On the other hand, it is quite possible that this great technology
    could go in the wrong direction, as seen in the example of Tay, if the technology
    of AI isn't handled appropriately. Therefore, we should be careful not to destroy
    this steadily developing technology.

  zh: 在本章中，我们从 AlphaGo 作为突发新闻的例子出发，探讨了深度学习将如何或应该发展。机器在某些领域战胜人类并不可怕，反而是人类成长的机会。另一方面，如果人工智能技术处理不当，这项伟大的技术可能会朝着错误的方向发展，正如
    Tay 的例子所示。因此，我们应小心谨慎，不要破坏这项正在稳步发展的技术。
- en: The field of deep learning is one that has the potential for hugely changing
    an era with just one idea. If you build AI in the near future, that AI is, so
    to speak, a pure existence without any knowledge. Thinking what to teach AI, how
    to interact with it, and how to make use of AI for humankind is humans' work.
    You, as a reader of this book, will lead a new technology in the right direction.
    Lastly, I hope you will get actively involved in the cutting edge of the field
    of AI.
