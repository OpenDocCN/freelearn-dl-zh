- en: Now that we’re in the period of **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) integration,
    we’re seeing many use cases of AI proliferating across industries. In our work
    managing AI products, we’ve certainly relied on AI consultants and PhD-level advisors
    to help us with modeling and orchestrating our data strategy to support a full-scale
    AI operation. However, as the rising tidal wave of AI continues to penetrate various
    companies and use cases, we’re seeing less of a reliance on breakthroughs achieved
    through advanced degrees. What’s most important now is familiarity with the use
    of even simple, reliable models. There’s a time and place for specialization.
    Data science and AI are massive umbrella terms but, based on my experiences as
    a product manager, I see a real need for data and AI generalists that can understand
    the use cases themselves and how they relate to a business perspective.

- en: In the age of AI breakthroughs, we didn’t have a wide selection of use cases
    because the data wasn’t as abundant as it is now. Now that data is abundant, we’re
    seeing a profound shift. Instead of the focus being on researching and discovering
    the most leading-edge algorithms to choose in the first place, the focus is now
    on acquiring enough talent to use the tried and true models and algorithms. What
    we particularly like about this is the concept of AI democratization, or the idea
    that AI is becoming accessible to more groups of people outside research and MAANG
    companies.

- en: The professionals are a good place to start with grouping products. AI will
    gravitate first toward use cases that can be profitable and allow for research
    and optimization. Because B2B products are products that are made for and used
    by other businesses, their use case is oriented completely toward the business
    world. This impacts everything from how they’re marketed to how they’re bought,
    sold, used, and negotiated. So many B2B products speak to the business impact
    that a product can satisfy for a customer across multiple levels. It’s a great
    way to learn potentially helpful applications of AI.

    data to train on. Specifically, one of the ethical challenges with this expansion
    in data and AI products is being able to offer large amounts of data without leaking
    information that can identify you as a person, also known as **private personal
    information** (**PPI**). Hazy, a UK-based AI company, offers its customers just
    that: the ability to derive insights, understand signals, and share data using
    what’s called synthetic data. Synthetic data is data that mimics real-world scenarios
    but is created in virtual worlds, and what it’s mimicking is the statistical similarity
    with real-world datasets. Because of the nature of data-hungry deep learning models,
    synthetic data is preferred when training neural networks and because of that,
    Hazy has a bright future ahead of itself. The company’s done a lot with its modest
    $3M in funding and has added a number of marquee customers to its roster in a

    businesses’ pain points when it comes to data availability, and it’s evident in
    the loyalty of their customer base. Another way Hazy maintains this loyalty is
    by educating its customers on the ethical and legal ramifications of traditional

- en: Another great example of an AI company driving success in the B2B marketplace
    is a California-based gaming company called GGWP. While they don’t create their
    own games, they use AI to reduce toxicity in the gaming culture and provide gaming
    companies with a dashboard where they can see how their users are performing from
    a moderation perspective. As gaming companies consistently take a more serious
    look at the safety and health of their gaming communities, they will come to rely
    on companies such as GGWP to ensure all their users feel safe. Moderation has
    long been a topic of discussion in social media companies and gaming companies
    alike, and it’s really nice to find an AI company finding success in this field.

- en: GGWP is also a positive example that reminds us of the importance of leveraging
    AI over human workers in specific fields. The biggest issue in employing human
    moderators is first and foremost the emotional toll it takes on their mental health
    as they go about their day. Scanning for hurtful or violent language isn’t for
    the faint of heart, and finding depictions of graphic or hateful content on a
    consistent basis can deflate even the strongest of us. There’s a strong case to
    be made for the ethical use of AI in helping us tackle the problems we, as human
    beings, would rather not be tasked with.

  zh: GGWP也是一个积极的例子，提醒我们在特定领域利用AI代替人工工人的重要性。雇佣人工版主的最大问题，首先是他们在日常工作中承受的情感压力。扫描有害或暴力语言并不适合胆小的人，而且在持续不断地发现恶心或仇恨内容时，甚至最坚强的人也会感到沮丧。在伦理上使用AI来帮助我们解决那些我们不愿意承担的任务，是有很大道理的。
- en: The professionals seemed most fitting for this bunch. When selling to other
    businesses in the B2B world, there’s a standard operating procedure most businesses
    are comfortable with following. This includes everything from sales tactics to
    the approvals of budgets or statements of work to getting contracts approved through
    leadership, procurement, and all stakeholder teams in between. Because most B2B
    products are concerned with cost saving, productivity, or revenue generation,
    there are more structured interactions between all the players involved. The spirit
    of a professional is competence and integrity, no matter what arises in the moment,
    and B2B markets can be thought of in many ways as well-oiled machines. Much like
    the products they represent, these companies themselves are looking for ways to
    optimize productivity, generate revenue, and lower costs in their sales cycles
    and market interactions.

    that are built with the expectation that the product will be bought and used by
    individual consumers rather than other businesses. With B2C products, there’s
    a feeling that you’re looking for a way to satisfy the needs and tastes of many
    individuals. Upon further reflection, B2C companies are looking to satisfy the
    few common collective needs of millions. The more due diligence that goes into

    by bringing up the very real risks that might impact every company that’s creating

    Let’s take an example such as fast fashion, a highly competitive market if we’ve
    ever seen one. If you’re a fast fashion retailer, it’s not only important to have
    a cheaper product, but you must have operations to support the delivery of that
    product more efficiently. Think Netflix, a good example in its heyday, but today
    we struggle to find a better example than SHEIN. The Chinese brand manifests its
    dominant strategy by leveraging AI to better anticipate new trends and predict
    demand for certain products in the market and it marries that data with its supply
    chain to ensure that it can deliver on changes in demand to its customers’ delight.

    what the emerging trends on the horizon in AI are. We believe all product managers
    need to have a streak of futurism in their composition. Having a grasp of where
    things are in the recent and present moments provides a snapshot with which to
    evaluate your existing strategy. But in tech, things evolve pretty quickly. In
    business, projections and future goals can change from week to week as well.
