    about types of generative AI models, and briefly discussed LLM-powered AI agents.
    In this chapter, we will discuss the basic principles of agentic systems, starting
    with a brief discussion about the concept of agency and autonomy, followed by
    a discussion about intelligent agents and their characteristics. We will also
    discuss various agentic system architectures as well as multi-agent systems through
    the lens of the travel booking assistant example that we discussed in the previous

    or entity to govern or control itself autonomously, without external direction
    or control. In the context of agentic systems, self-governance implies that the
    system can make its own decisions, set its own goals, and regulate its behavior
    based on its internal rules, models, and decision-making algorithms. Basically,
    they operate according to their rules and internal states, and execute a change
    of behavior, if necessary, due to a change of the environment or the objectives.

    absence of human oversight or control. Often, these systems operate within well-defined

    additional information, such as travel dates, locations, name, and address, from
    the user to make flight bookings. It then cross-references this data with available
    flights, suggesting options that match the user’s preferences. If any detail is

    travel industry operations. For example, agents may employ multi-attribute utility
    functions that consider factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, and customer
    preferences to evaluate and rank various proposals. They can then engage in iterative
    negotiations, adjusting their offers and counter offers based on their respective
    utility functions and constraints.

  zh: 在整个谈判过程中，代理人可以利用各种策略和算法来评估提案、生成反提案以及寻找双方都能接受的协议。这些策略可能包括拍卖、谈判协议、博弈论方法或针对旅游行业运营优化的算法。例如，代理人可能会采用多属性效用函数，考虑诸如旅行时间、成本、舒适度和客户偏好等因素来评估和排名各种提案。然后，他们可以进行迭代谈判，根据各自的效用函数和约束条件调整他们的出价和反出价。
- en: Moreover, the distributed nature of MAS allows decentralized decision-making,
    where each agent can make decisions based on its local knowledge and constraints,
    while still collaborating and coordinating with other agents to achieve global
    optimization goals. The negotiation mechanisms in MAS for our travel and hospitality
    example not only facilitate efficient coordination among various entities but
    also provide the flexibility and adaptability to handle dynamic changes in demand,
    supply, pricing changes, or other operational factors, ultimately leading to a
    more resilient and responsive system that caters to customer demands.

- en: In this chapter, we explored the intriguing world of agentic systems and intelligent
    agents, delving into the core concepts of agency, autonomy, and the characteristics
    that define an ideal agent. We studied various architectural patterns for designing
    and implementing such systems, including deliberative, reactive, and hybrid approaches.
    Additionally, we examined MASs, where multiple agents collaborate and coordinate
    to achieve collective goals through mechanisms such as cooperation, coordination,
    and negotiation.
