- en: The average cost of opening a leased restaurant in the US is $275,000, and only
    about 20% of new restaurants survive past their first five years. This means that
    there are many failures, but also many opportunities for those willing to take
    risks and try new things.

  zh: 此外，除了考虑客户获取成本外，还需要关注竞争对手的相关成本；如果附近的其他商家提供大量折扣，那么您可能需要匹配或超过这些优惠。
- en: You should also be aware of any local or state incentives that may be available
    to help offset the costs of your restaurant. For example, if you are in the process
    of opening a new location, then there may be grants and tax breaks available that
    can reduce your CACs.

    the pricing structure of your business – and more specifically, the *why* behind
    what you are charging for your products or services. If you are currently charging
    too little for your offerings, then the chances are that this is resulting in
    lost revenue and a decreased overall bottom line.

  zh: 提高盈利能力的第三个关注点涉及到你商业的定价结构——更具体地说，是你收取的产品或服务费用背后的*原因*。如果你目前对你的产品定价过低，那么很可能导致收入损失和整体利润的下降。
- en: To put it simply, if people aren't willing to pay enough for what you have to
    offer, then they probably won't be returning for future purchases – no matter
    how good those previous purchases were. You can increase profits by raising prices
    on selected items that are in high demand while simultaneously lowering prices
    on other items that may not be as highly sought after. This will help ensure that
    the balance between the sales volume and average ticket price remains favorable
    over time.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 简单来说，如果人们不愿意为你提供的产品支付足够的费用，那么他们很可能不会再回来购买——无论之前的购买有多好。你可以通过提高一些高需求商品的价格来增加利润，同时降低其他需求较低商品的价格。这将有助于确保销售量和平均票价之间的平衡随着时间推移保持有利。
- en: Be sure to also take into consideration any promotions or discounts being offered
    by competitors (or possibly even by yourself in the past) as well as any tax implications
    associated with any such changes. There may be opportunities here to further increase
    profitability based on tax laws or certain government incentives currently in
    place. Most importantly, however, is analyzing pricing and demand data at scale
    to calculate the optimal pricing strategy.

  zh: 还需要考虑竞争对手（或你自己过去可能提供的）任何促销或折扣，以及与这些变化相关的税务影响。根据当前的税法或政府激励措施，可能会有进一步增加盈利的机会。然而，最重要的是在大规模分析定价和需求数据的基础上，计算出最优定价策略。

- en: These changing guest preferences impact profitability and forecasts as well.
    For example, there's a new reality of smaller dine-in sales overall, as well as
    decreased check sizes. As a result, restaurants have to look for new ways to bring
    in revenue, in addition to satisfying customers based on their new preferences.
    For example, restaurants can consider changing their menu or even implementing
    technology to better help them adhere to social distancing protocols (for example,
    contactless payment options and QR codes for menus).

  zh: 这些不断变化的顾客偏好也影响着盈利和预测。例如，总体上就餐销售额的下降，以及账单金额的减少已经成为一种新的现实。因此，餐厅除了根据顾客的新偏好来满足他们的需求外，还需要寻找新的方式来增加收入。例如，餐厅可以考虑更改菜单，甚至实施技术手段来帮助遵守社交距离协议（例如，无接触支付选项和二维码菜单）。
- en: Preferences come down to context. What do guests see? Who are they with? How
    hungry are they? Where are they dining? And what else are they doing during their
    visit (for example, shopping at nearby stores)? These contextual factors play
    an important role in determining whether an experience will be memorable or not,
    and whether guests will want to share it with others or not (hence why engagement
    metrics on social media become so important).
  id: totrans-41

  zh: 偏好取决于情境。顾客看到的是什么？他们和谁一起？他们有多饿？他们在哪里就餐？他们在就餐时还做什么（例如，去附近的商店购物）？这些情境因素在决定一次体验是否值得记住以及顾客是否愿意与他人分享中起着重要作用（因此社交媒体上的互动指标变得至关重要）。
- en: 'The key takeaway here is that every guest has different needs based on their
    individual situation, which means that no two experiences will be exactly alike.
    To stand out amidst today''s crowded landscape requires both creativity and innovation:
    you need something different that your competitors don''t have – access to massive

    will perform in-market. By analyzing the performance of food items in the restaurant
    industry at large, restaurateurs can identify which food items are likely to be
    most popular with consumers. This information can then be used to inform business
    decisions about menu items, pricing, and marketing campaigns.
