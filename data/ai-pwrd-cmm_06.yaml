- en: Luxury goods are associated with exclusivity and prestige, which makes product
    development particularly tough. There's a far smaller, more exclusive market of
    people to target, and traditional methods of market research, such as focus groups,
    fall short in luxury markets, which are largely made up of **high-net-worth individuals**
    (**HNWIs**).

- en: Moreover, the value of a luxury goods company comes largely from its brand,
    so analyzing brand data is of special importance. At the same time, luxury brands
    naturally have far fewer customers than mass-market brands, which means that getting
    that data through normal means proves to be a real challenge.
