			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Recognizing the Power of Design in ChatGPT</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">If you only like to play with ChatGPT, this book is not for you. Read on to make a quality user experience for customers by incorporating ChatGPT or various alternative language models that span the gamut of cost, quality, and expertise. Every new technology has too many people jumping on the bandwagon only to abandon it with failure. It is widespread. Why? Because they don’t know what they don’t know. But we know what it takes to make successful ChatGPT solutions for the enterprise. We will take you from zero to hero in your organization. Do you want poor-quality interactions or targeted, intelligent results that resonate with customers? Should they feel empowered and able to explore further with the confidence that they are understood? If it is the latter, this book will focus on user experience design methods, practices, and tools to help decide what to do, design the most effective solutions, and verify that they do what they should do. We can apply user interface practices to the ChatGPT life cycle, leaving you confident to create quality solutions.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This book is intended for designers or design-related professionals, such as product managers, product owners, writers, linguists, or developers, who want to understand how to apply design principles and practices to improve the generative AI experience of customers and employees. For those exposed to design methodologies, they won’t be novel, but their application will be. For those<a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> with limited exposure to the science of <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) design (or UXD), we will provide enough learning to make you dangerous and help create enterprise-grade ChatGPT solutions.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">You might have yet to work with generative AI products such as ChatGPT in a production way, maybe only using some of these tools at home or to supplement work. We will only get into some of the explanations of how ChatGPT works in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em> as we have some ground to cover first. The book follows a typical design. First, we help figure out what to do, prioritize that work, then how to do it, and finally, how to interpret and improve on what was done. We have found the design skills and tips in this book to work for a wide range of design challenges, and through our experience in the last seven years with AI solutions and 30 years of UXD, we have adapted those insights to the creation of generative AI solutions. Following design processes will help one craft high-quality solutions driven by ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Traversing the history of conversational AI</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Appreciating the importance of UX design</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Understanding the science and art of UX design</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Setting up a customized model</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">There are two ways to work with this book: follow along and learn the principles and practices and use one of the OpenAI playgrounds, which is typically a <em class="italic">no-code</em> approach, or use the APIs provided by ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We have examples in our book’s GitHub repository. If this is your first time using GitHub, it is a place where we will store any materials needed to download to complete the examples in the book. It is an online folder of resources.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Repository for book materials</a> (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/</a>)</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Make sure you have a ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> account.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Website: <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">OpenAI Chat</a> (<a href="https://chat.openai.com/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://chat.openai.com/</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">That is easy; everyone should have that. We will try out some of the material as we go. This will also allow us to use the Playground, essential for some demos. We have a QR code at the end of each chapter, so all of the references we provide, such as the preceding links, are available online for easier access.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Approach 1 – The no-code approach</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">You can learn about 80% of this material by<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> just reading, but some folks do better by doing. If you go this way, focus on the design practices and methods and learn how to apply those to any generative AI solution. We will give demos and samples to try without coding. Give the examples a try; understanding how an LLM reacts is critical.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Approach 2 – code with Node.JS, Python, or curl</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">If you don’t already have a ChatGPT account, set one up. Then, head to the quick start guide to ensure Node.js (curl or Python) works. The URL has step-by-step instructions for getting your environment up and running.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Website: <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Quickstart guide for developers</a> (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node</a>)</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">This book does not require coding. A more technical reader can mirror some of our no-code approaches with a code version, but we won’t discuss this path.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">To use the APIs, follow the instructions on the link:</p>
			<ol class="calibre12">
				<li class="calibre8">Install the essential software (Node.js, Python, or curl are all documented on the same page; choose the tab that suits you).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Install the OpenAI library package.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Set up your API key.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre3">And give it a try! If you have used other <strong class="bold">Large Language Models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) or have never used one, try it<a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> out and ask anything; we call this input from the user a prompt. <em class="italic">The material in this book can be quickly learned without doing any coding</em>. Some models don’t have the most recent data, so asking about today’s weather or sports scores won’t work, but if asked to give five ways to clean a clogged toilet, it has the answer. The power we want to expose here is the combination of this powerful experience and UX design practices to create a high-quality, customer-centric experience. Now we have something to discuss!</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We should be on the same page concerning the basic history of conversational AI. With all the news, ChatGPT should be well known so we can cover just the basics for a few minutes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Traversing the history of conversational AI</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Interaction design intersected<a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> with AI well before the LLM revolution. This history is helpful to appreciate when applying design principles to the latest conversational experiences. Any discussion of AI at least mentions Alan Turing and the question posed by his article in Mind (a peer-reviewed academic journal).</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950)</a> (<a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This is routinely <a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>referenced as the <strong class="bold">Turing Test</strong>. The ability of a machine to seem intelligent and be indistinguishable from a human.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia on the Turing Test</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">When this was published in 1950, we were still far from a computer being indistinguishable from a human, at least in a text-only interaction. We must skip ahead to the mid-1960s before we see something that appears to engage in discourse.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If we try out one of ELIZA’s conversational interfaces from 1964 to 1967, we quickly see its limitations based on its <em class="italic">natural</em> responses when recognizing keywords or phrases.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia on ELIZA</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The well-known version is called DOCTOR. It turns written questions asked of it back onto the patient. Give it a try to interact with the psychotherapist chatbot.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Demo: <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">ELIZA</a> – The psychotherapist chatbot (<a href="https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">ELIZA was considered one of the first attempts at passing the Turing Test. With its simple psychotherapist banter to simulate a doctor (“Why do you feel this way?”), it was perceived as human-like. Without going too deep, the discussion around its design looked at the rank of essential words, and it included <em class="italic">transformation</em> rules that dictated how it treats what the user types. Maybe LLMs are paying homage to this since they are<a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> based on <strong class="bold">transformers</strong>. We will explain transformers and the terms common to LLMs in later chapters. ELIZA had the superficial appearance of a conversation and could not go <em class="italic">off-topic</em> or even provide an answer. The psychology of conversational interaction was fundamental to this experience. But it wasn’t going to solve anyone’s psychological problems. However, things did get better as chatbots; it just took a few decades. Visit Wikipedia to learn a brief history of chatbots.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia’s history of chatbots</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The idea of a <em class="italic">natural language</em> experience was not lost on the research community from the 1960s to the 2000s. Still, the next step in evolution came with the conversational assistants or chatbots we have seen since around 2016. And this is where interaction design had a significant impact, even though most chatbots were not worth anyone’s time. About 100,000 chatbots were created on Facebook Messenger in the first year of its support. I would suggest that 99% of them failed quickly. Very few survived for all the reasons we will explain shortly. But a few lived on when teams were willing to mature the solution. Support use cases, such as for airlines (“How much is a second bag going to cost?” or “Can I get a refund for a canceled ticket?”), are a great place to answer specific questions with specific answers. Although it seems evident that this can save a company a lot of money in support costs versus a phone call, there is also value to the consumer. For them, time is also valuable. If a customer gets a reliable answer in seconds, they will gladly trade that for 10 minutes of holding onto the phone. It is a win-win. Additionally, this experience can be a frontend for required interactions with humans. In support cases, it can gather details reliably before engaging a human, making it more likely to connect with the right human and give them the details they need to help more directly.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Imagine a young child before going<a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to school. If no one interacts with kids, teaches them, or plays with them, by the time they go to first grade, they lack primary language and interpersonal skills and might not be potty trained. Even the great comedian Steve Martin understood this. Please take a minute and laugh at his bit.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40K6rApRnhQ" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Steve Martin teaching a kid for the first day of school</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40K6rApRnhQ" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40K6rApRnhQ</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">However, remarkable changes can be made by investing in a child’s growth and care and feeding them physically and mentally. This maturity is what we can see in chatbots. They won’t typically become a Ph.D., but they can coached to be smarter than a 5th grader. We can use design skills to make a chatbot (or any LLM-based solution) knowledgeable, dependable, and articulate. We will apply what we have learned to our next generation of conversational assistants built with ChatGPT. We will critically explore ChatGPT to form robust solutions, and you will learn to notice when there might be other tools out there to use in conjunction with ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There is one other related area worth<a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> mentioning. Everyone has experience with phone trees when calling a business. We mentioned this example earlier. Eventually, those “Press 1 for service, press 2 for sales…” gave way to experiences that listened for more than the touch tone of a key press. But how many of us have struggled with these? Probably all of us. Why? Because the experience isn’t designed well, and the technology is likely lacking. These, too, will benefit from ChatGPT. So, if you come from creating voice experiences (probably using Voice XML, the de facto standard for modeling interactions for years) or from chatbots within Alexa, Siri, Google, or dozens of other vendors, the learnings and practices of making great experiences apply to ChatGPT. We will go<a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> through that extensively in this book.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia’s Voice XML background</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">And yet so many of these chatbots, phone trees, or conversational experiences fail to help a primary user accomplish their task. Why? Because of a few critical reasons:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">The features or services in the chatbots don’t match the user’s needs</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The models don’t support the complexity of the user’s language</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The user’s primary spoken language might not be supported, requiring them to be understood in a secondary language or not be understood at all</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The chatbots only know what they know, so they will return seemingly random results, which is discouraging</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The chatbots do not respond in a voice or tone the customer expects</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The chatbot should have been monitored and improved to address these issues</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Your goal should be to set a higher quality bar than expected from a human performing the same task. Sounds crazy? It isn’t. A typical support person might be able to help with a narrow topic (say, a website password reset). Another agent would be needed to resolve billing issues or find missing payments. So, the average support person will be less helpful than the future state of well-trained ChatGPT advisors with access to all the institutional data and processes.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This brings us to the founding of companies such as OpenAI. This long history of machine learning models and the increased computational capabilities allow this very large language model to work. OpenAI didn’t come into the world view with the December 2022 release of ChatGPT 3.5, the company was founded seven years earlier with non-profit roots. It took over three years to go from GPT-2, which could generate human-like text, to the 3.5 version that gained worldwide attention. For those who like tech history, dive into a brief background on OpenAI.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/OpenAI" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">The origins of OpenAI</a> (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/OpenAI" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.britannica.com/money/OpenAI</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Like many Silicon Valley companies, engineers from Google Brain (and DeepMind, which merged with Google), Facebook, and other AI came together at OpenAI. Then, 11 OpenAI employees left to form Anthropic around the start of 2021. None of this happened overnight, so we need to remind ourselves that it will take years for this new technology to weave its way into our everyday lives. The phone, the car, the computer, and the mobile phone have all become fundamental to today’s modern society. This will impact all of us more than all these previous inventions, but it will take time to happen. There will be a lot of failures along the way.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Imagine a solution that is 60% accurate at every interaction. Does it sound high for a computer to get something right 60% of the time? Before ChatGPT, some didn’t consider this too bad. I routinely used to ask this in my classes (typically from 20 to 100 people per class) on conversational AI. And many folks consider a 50–80% success rate to be  “pretty good.”</p>
			<p class="calibre3">With some simple<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> assumptions, we can understand why these systems fail. Every time a question is asked, the likelihood of a failure increases, as modeled in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.2</em>. To keep this simple, we base this on the independent probability of each turn having the same chance of failure. The system doesn’t know it has failed, and if the user trusts it, they might not even notice the failure, thus causing more failures.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B21964_010_02.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre4"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – The chance of failure increases at each turn</p>
			<p class="calibre3">When asked six questions at a 60% likelihood of success rate, there is a 95% chance of one of those answers being wrong. And what if your next question is dependent on the previous answer? The interaction will go off the rails. I have seen this time and time again. If the user trusts the (wrong) answer, they make the next decision based on that (incorrect) answer. And failure can be assured. This relationship will sour. Customers will go elsewhere if they see these failures (likely a more expensive channel) to get their needs addressed, or worse, they will go to another vendor.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can consider strategies to improve<a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> these curves so that each turn is more likely to succeed. <em class="italic">Chapters 6</em>, <em class="italic">7</em>, and <em class="italic">8</em> explain strategies to use multiple generative AI components to do different forms of validation. Yes, the AI can watch over another AI. While traditional LLMs such as ChatGPT have improved and will continue to improve, we want to provide tools and measurement skills to help ensure success. But look at <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.2</em> again. Look at raising the bar to 97% accuracy. After the same number of turns, there is a very good chance (85%) that all interactions were successful. So, raise the bar on expectations.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">It is possible to achieve these levels of quality. We will also show how to measure and scope improvements to give the most significant return on investment.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Chatbot failures</p>
			<p class="callout">To get<a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> a laugh at how bad <em class="italic">bad</em> can be, read this article on chatbot fails. We aim to teach enough design methods to never fall into these black holes of disgrace.</p>
			<p class="callout">Article: <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/chatbot-fail/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Chatbot failures</a> (<a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/chatbot-fail/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://research.aimultiple.com/chatbot-fail/</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">With purpose-built experiences, for example, focused on filing business expenses or getting answers to common questions around internal business processes, users spend less energy trying to break the chat experience or ask off-the-wall questions. This behavior, expected in widely available public ChatGPT and chatbot experiences, is likely seen less than 1% of the time when building a custom ChatGPT tool. It will still get questions it might not be able to answer, but it is more likely that they are questions it should <em class="italic">eventually</em> answer. We will show how to prioritize that backlog to be in the business of continuous improvement.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This brings us to ChatGPT and the new class of LLMs, which are indistinguishable from humans in many ways. Google’s LaMDA, Meta’s Llama, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s GPT models are all in the same class of software.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">But even if they are like humans, we must ask which humans in the enterprise space they mimic. Does this represent my company? Does it have the knowledge it needs to solve my customers’ problems? How will my customer handle a wrong answer? LLMs have a lot of potential and will evolve rapidly. We aim to give you the tools to evaluate whether an LLM solution will fit at every stage of your development.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The importance of UX design for ChatGPT</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Does ChatGPT even need<a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> an introduction at this point? The innovative model<a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> developed by OpenAI is in a new class of LLMs, which are trained on billions of data elements from the internet’s vast supply of articles, books, and knowledge. It achieved over 100 million users in about two months. It can generate human-like conversational interactions in text or voice in many languages and converse on vast information. And it does it pretty darn fast.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">ChatGPT has undoubtedly come on like a firestorm. Unique, fun, fast, intelligent? However, when designing solutions for your business or enterprise, they should be accurate, have the most current business-related information, and communicate to customers in the voice, style, and tone expected from the business. So, how do you take such a fast-paced moving target and wrap it into a product that exceeds customer’s expectations? Can one ensure that it doesn’t give random answers that are off-brand? You can, but it takes design. It needs to be monitored. And it would be best if a process was in place to improve it. For that, this is the right place.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let me define <em class="italic">design</em> because I see a lot of really horrible definitions. Design is the process and practice of clearly communicating an experience for a user. Good software UX design accounts for human behavior and limitations by applying the scientific method to solving human and machine interface issues. This means we can use what we know about the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems and combine them with understanding how the mind works to make decisions on how to create an experience that is functional, usable, needed, and even engaging. We see design all around us: visual design, graphic design, software design, conversational design, building architecture, and many other fields. We use the expertise of user researchers to guide our designs based on subjective and objective feedback from our customers, using formal and informal methods to better understand our users’ needs. We then combine the inputs from customers, primary research, and the goals of the product and company and mix in a bit of magic to make great experiences.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you just put icons on screens or write conversational copy without these efforts, you do production work, not design. We want everything done for a reason. The more done by creating fitness to purpose, the more our customer experience will improve. We don’t always get it right. We will get a higher quality product if we know how to fulfill the user’s needs. That is where the iterative design concept plays a role. We learn from and improve our designs even if we don’t get it right.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">UX design, interface<a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> design, human factors, user research, <strong class="bold">human-computer interaction</strong> (<strong class="bold">HCI</strong>), or any flavor of the art and science of interaction design is a collection of experts and expertise that can help shape this functional, engaging, usable, and fun experience. We can build successful chat-based solutions by directly applying the wealth of learnings from these disciplines to “chat” experiences or adapting what we have learned with conversational AI and graphical user experience design to fit into this new world. Using words to communicate with a computer is not new; it has just improved.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This is where you learn how to design a ChatGPT solution for customers based on company knowledge and business needs. Enterprise ChatGPT covers a wide range of experiences. One can be making a support site, a virtual assistant to help employees or job seekers, a sales engagement service that personalizes emails for sales calls, a training application, a product finder or recommender, a tool to analyze legal documents for inconsistencies, or an expert witness tool for lawyers. Code review (evaluating software written in Java or dozens of other popular languages and identifying issues or bugs) is another popular topic in tech. This book will stay away from that use case to focus on more common experiences that will impact most people, most of the time, with something important to their lives as enterprise customers. Developer productivity <a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>tools are essential, but that topic is well covered<a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> elsewhere. The learnings also apply to that space; we won’t use any examples or case studies from developer productivity tools. We will start by discussing the science and art of good design in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor023" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Understanding the science and art of UX design</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Every coin has two sides (okay, plus the edge!). Typically, we see two sides to UX design. Those with visual backgrounds and those who come from a science perspective. Schools are now overwhelmingly delivering visual and graphic artists to meet demand, and with conversational AI, there is some <em class="italic">art</em> to the experience but only sometimes visual elements. The introduction of generative AI impacts every facet of interaction design. The design r<a id="_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>oles will adapt or die. Adaption is the better option. As <strong class="bold">graphical user interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUIs</strong>) adapt to include conversational elements, the role<a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> of a visual designer will still be relevant, even if only to create the correct prompts to help them generate the look and feel that aligns with the organization’s goals. The side of the equation for the science of design remains vital to requirements, understanding, and communication. Even when writing this book, ChatGPT provides some good answers related to UX. But what we cover in this book is not quickly answered by ChatGPT or any generative solutions. They help us, like all tools, move our design culture forward, but they don’t know when they are wrong and still need us to decide where to apply the solutions, gather the correct data to help them form answers, and understand and improve the results.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor025" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The science of design</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">“<em class="italic">Anyone can design</em>,” “<em class="italic">Just put the button there</em>,” “<em class="italic">I can write this copy</em>.” There<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> is a difference between designing and making something. Anyone can make something. It might or might not work; it could work for some and not others, “<em class="italic">I designed this for myself, and I don’t have any issues with it</em>,” or it could be good. We want to use the tools, expertise, wisdom, and field knowledge to ensure <em class="italic">design decisions</em> yield the highest quality product. There is a wealth of research that usually underpins quality interactions, and we want to avoid pitfalls.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">When we mean research, we include controlled studies with human subjects where the team has undergone rigorous processes to return reliable, repeatable, and valid results. We then take these results and apply them to our situation. And some will say, “<em class="italic">That doesn’t apply to this because it is different</em>.” Well, it could be, but that is why we share these results with interaction designers to guide us to what is applicable. As ChatGPT grows and integrates with other products and features, it will become more intertwined with visual elements, forms, interactive charts and visualizations, and even typical GUIs (with buttons, tables, filters, tabs, and all the components we see in any mobile, desktop, web, or embedded experience). This will make the science and historical expertise of UX design even more critical.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s take an example—Hick’s Law; designers know and use Hick’s Law all the time. “<em class="italic">The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases</em>.” This is why we have menus broken up into small segments, wizards for complex processes, and debate how many buttons should appear in a dialog box. In conversational flows, we keep decisions simple to reduce the burden on the user.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Hick-Hyman Law</p>
			<p class="callout">This law was published<a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> in 1952 in the <em class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>. It is an equation, <img src="img/1.png" alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" class="calibre13"/>, where the response time (<em class="italic">RT</em>) is a function of the time not included in the decision-making (<em class="italic">a</em>) plus a constant (about 0.155 seconds) times the <em class="italic">log</em> function of the number of alternatives to choose from (<em class="italic">n</em>).</p>
			<p class="callout">Article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia’s explanation of Hick-Hyman Law</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We don’t expect you to know or memorize this, but it is just one example of the science behind UX design decisions. Sometimes, knowing the guidelines, laws, and science helps you make better decisions and avoid mistakes by others, which you must learn to correct.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this case, we know that a long list of choices is complex for users, and when a generative AI returns 10 to 15 choices, the effort it takes to decide goes up significantly. With this example, we can get these choices grouped into smaller logical segments and reduce them to two less complex decisions in a series. This is why we have the <strong class="bold">File</strong>, <strong class="bold">Edit</strong>, <strong class="bold">View</strong>, <strong class="bold">Window</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Help</strong> menus. By grouping menu items, picking the action is a less complex decision. It is also why menus fail when there are too many choices and no clear understanding of the organization of those items. Let’s tell ChatGPT to return large decision trees as more logical and organized segments. We will cover this in <a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Prompt Engineering,</em> to give ChatGPT instructions on how we want our responses framed.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">How about one more classic<a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> example? Many phone calls to a business result in a voice prompt with 5-6-7-8 or even nine choices; how does a caller keep track of the right one? Do you ever have to listen to a prompt again? Maybe you got distracted and can’t recall the first few choices. Do you ever use a few fingers to represent a number to remind yourself which answer might be best when multiple options are viable? This is a human working memory issue, a classic design problem.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wikipedia explains working memory</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">These human factors impact the design of many experiences—especially ones based on a lot of text. We are not going to calculate Hick’s Law in this book or test on working memory. Still, one should appreciate that applying design principles will be the cornerstone of helping create a successful ChatGPT experience. Without guidance, no one should be prompted with 35 choices on the first menu. This is an unacceptable user experience. So, we could use an existing and well-organized tree and have ChatGPT (speech-to-text) determine the customer’s request to skip a few levels in one step.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Design book wish list</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are new to design and want to learn the fundamentals, there is a wealth of wonderful resources. I suggest a few non-technical first books, such as Don Norman’s <em class="italic">The Design of Everyday Things</em> or Steve Krug’s <em class="italic">Don’t Make </em><em class="italic">Me Think</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout">Those who are familiar with these works will want more sophisticated books. I suggest Jeff Johnson’s book <em class="italic">Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> to help you understand how the fundamentals of psychology are used to derive many of these guidelines and thus help you apply these principles. <em class="italic">Universal Principles of Design</em> by Lidwell, Holden, and Butler is an excellent reference book. More resources are on our book list.</p>
			<p class="callout">Website: <a href="https://uxdforai.com/references#C13" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Recommended Book List</a> (<a href="https://uxdforai.com/references#C13" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://uxdforai.com/references#C13</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">To make these experiences<a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> successful, think like a designer. Consider how users will interact, use their expectations, biases, and assumptions, and how their unique experiences will shape their future interactions. The power of the design mindset is to learn how to ensure people who use your product succeed.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">To be clear, this is very different from <em class="italic">I will know it when I see it</em>. You want to apply art and style to the product and understand the scientific underpinnings of success. Some of this comes from psychology and related disciplines. Humans’ cognitive and physical abilities have been unchanged over the last 50 years of the computer age. We still process information using the same senses. Our ability to react and respond is the same; only our experiences have evolved. We might now know how to type with two fingers, but there are limits to processing information, clicking on small targets, making decisions, or learning complex patterns. For example, just because today’s cars have two to five times the horsepower of vehicles in the 1960s doesn’t mean we can react any faster in an accident. As ChatGPT provides insights or understandings, we can overcome some cognitive<a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> or physical human limits using good UX practices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor026" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The art of design</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">I bet you were waiting<a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> for us to talk about visual design here. This will apply in some places but won’t be a book’s cornerstone. We could have covered how to design a chat window or what visual treatment works best, but I suspect that information is in many resources independent of a book on ChatGPT. Brand identity has its subjective standards and its collection of science and expertise. Now, there will be experiences that join generative AI and traditional user interfaces, and one can apply a visual style and expertise to that experience, but that is unique to the enterprise. We want to cover the art of design that can span any enterprise here and join this with the science that supports design. And all of this is done to create something expected and comfortable for the audience.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In meetings, we hear, “<em class="italic">Put on your designer hat</em>.” This means being a customer’s advocate and addressing customer’s needs through how they interact with the product. This is within the basics of user-centered design. We bring customers into the process because we sometimes need to learn better. Listening to the customer means something different than what the customer says is right. It isn’t, and it won’t be. Many times, what the customers ask for and what they need are different. They want to work around a problem, but maybe the solution is to eliminate the problem in the first place. This is why this is also an art. You have to know where to look for problems worth solving.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Engaging users in the process will help us understand expectations and see how designs impact their behavior. And we know that generative AI will only sometimes give the expected results. Part of the designer’s job is to improve this interaction, likely indirectly, through the tools we will discuss in the book, such as data cleaning, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, user research, user testing, and monitoring. There is also art we need to control and refine in generating responses with AI. As Kevin Mullet explained in a conversation for this book, “<em class="italic">The science describes how things ought to be done, while the generative AI describes (ideally) how they are typically done today. The designer’s task (as always) is to wrangle those diverse inputs into a single coherent solution that best maps to the user’s wants and needs</em>.” So, we need to use our depth of skills to keep our ChatGPT solutions on point.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">To be fair to the process, only some decisions can be based on logic or a research method, especially regarding how you want ChatGPT to respond. Let’s break down the art concept as it applies to the words used in a product’s voice, style, and tone.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s take a large company selling surfing apparel, surfboards, and beach equipment. The website or style should be distinct from a stodgy, old-fashioned bank. Right, dude, and <em class="italic">dudettes</em>? Likewise, a bank intends to come across as reliable, safe, dependable, and trustworthy, Mrs. Customer. So, the site should speak to customers in a manner consistent with their expectations for the brand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The overall <em class="italic">voice</em> of your conversations should reflect the brand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The <em class="italic">style</em> of interactions should match the users’ needs, wants, and expectations.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">And the <em class="italic">tone</em> of the conversation can adapt or vary based on the current situation.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We will address these in detail to identify when and how to vary the tone within a style for the overall voice of a ChatGPT assistant.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There is no one correct answer<a id="_idIndexMarker025" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to how to write. The voice, style, and tone can certainly overlap in concept. The same thing can be said in many ways and still be understood:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Your appointment is now scheduled for this coming Monday.
I have scheduled you to see the doctor on Monday.
Confirmed. I have a Monday appointment in the books.</pre>			<p class="calibre3">We will discuss how to ensure that responses are clear, concise, and contain the right level of detail (maybe the customer wondered when the appointment was? Or maybe at what office?). Or perhaps they expected a calendar (<code>.ical</code> or similar) attachment to make it easier to add this appointment to a calendar:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Got it. Monday at 3:00 pm at the Palo Alto office. Here is the <strong class="bold1">calendar entry</strong><strong class="bold1">.</strong></pre>			<p class="calibre3">If a manager scheduled this appointment at the surf shop we mentioned, they would use lingo and tone that fits the customers to make the customer feel like one of them:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Akaw! We got you, grom. Swing by for your intro lesson on Mondo at 3 at the Santa Monica beach shop.</pre>			<p class="calibre3">An intelligent designer will know that even if the audience doesn’t know <em class="italic">Akaw</em> (awesome or cool) and <em class="italic">grom</em> (a new surfer), they can still understand<a id="_idIndexMarker026" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the message and be a little excited to get their surf on.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre11">Use cases for this book</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">This is where the art and science of design meet. And we will see this a lot in our journey. We will demand that our ChatGPT instance be clear, complete, and conversational (when needed). Using ChatGPT to create answers that present themselves in a non-conversational<a id="_idIndexMarker027" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> user interface is also perfectly reasonable. ChatGPT can process and generate data in a backend system. A UI can use alerts, buttons, or a warning dialog supplemented by ChatGPT. We call that a hybrid user experience. A combination of traditional UI elements and generative AI. Grammar or style suggestions when writing an email could be made in a suggestion window, and it doesn’t have to be conversational. We will refer to these as recommenders. They provide recommendations to assist in content generation or to influence a process, such as a sales lead.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s illustrate these concepts with pictures. Each gives a sense of the experiences covered in the book’s examples. If your use case differs but will still be a user interface, then most of what we cover will likely apply.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre14">Messaging</h4>
			<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Simple text messaging</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMS</strong>), voice experiences, or simple<a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> chats are two-way user<a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> experiences that can only use text or <a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>speech. These experiences have limited interactions in SMS: text, images, file uploading, and links. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.3</em> shows an example of interacting with my expense assistant on the phone via SMS. It is easy to access and simple but has limits to<a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the types of interactions it can support.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – An example of simple messaging via SMS on a mobile phone</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If this was a voice <a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>experience, like in a car, or a skill in Amazon Alexa, creating well-done voice-only solutions is even more challenging than with SMS. We<a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> will discuss voice experiences in the book, but we should discuss Hybrid UIs next, as that is the future.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre14">Hybrid UIs</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">Slack, Teams, and web interfaces<a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> can incorporate user interface elements with <a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>conversational text. Simple experiences can have links, buttons, charts, graphs, or forms. This hybrid experience combines LLMs and GUIs, allowing for complexities not quickly addressed by generative text or GUI components alone. In <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, I show a simple example from Slack where buttons encourage the exploration of tasks.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://www.cityam.com/slack-to-offer-users-a-chatgpt-ai-tool-which-will-write-messages-for-them-in-seconds/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">ChatGPT AI for Slack</a> (<a href="https://www.cityam.com/slack-to-offer-users-a-chatgpt-ai-tool-which-will-write-messages-for-them-in-seconds/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.cityam.com/slack-to-offer-users-a-chatgpt-ai-tool-which-will-write-messages-for-them-in-seconds/</a>)</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – An example of a hybrid user experience</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Overall, experiences in more robust <a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>channels can take advantage of even more creative elements. For example, a web channel might support interactive charts or visualizations, shopping cart items, information, tools, and products from the enterprise. Generative conversations can refine <a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the results or change perspective or filters, while UI components also control aspects of the view. This is by far the most robust<a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> and creative space for generative solutions.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre11">Recommender UIs</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Typically, a recommender<a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> is a recommendation as a textual prompt to encourage a specific behavior. It could be done with action buttons, but the user does not interact or converse with a system. A summary or writing suggestion tool is typically this kind of experience. Even if it has buttons to “generate email,” if the user is not conversationally interacting with the generative agent, it is more like a recommender. In this Salesforce<a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> example in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, Einstein gives context to the sales process.</p>

			<h3 class="calibre11">The backend uses for ChatGPT</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">A hidden use of a generative AI solution<a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> can be to process information and provide data, information, or wisdom to the user that is then passed to a different user experience. The user doesn’t directly interact with the generative AI, so a UI doesn’t exist. There could be administrative UIs or UIs that use the processed results. In <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, we don’t see a user interface. We see data that would be ingested, processed, and then analyzed to return clean, normalized data. We will explore this example in a case study starting in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em>. Just realize we don’t have to have a UI to get much value out of ChatGPT and generative solutions; we might use it as a tool in a much larger process.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B21964_010_06.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre4"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – Spreadsheets processed in a backend ChatGPT solution</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I suspect these four concepts cover almost all uses of textual generative AI. The most interesting for us are ones with richer or robust UX, while something like a pure backend solution leaves little discussion to improve the user experience. But we do have examples! Sometimes, work starts<a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> as a backend solution, and then, with the need for controls and feedback mechanisms, these experiences come to the forefront. None of this work can be done in isolation. It takes a team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor027" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>It takes a village to create superb UX</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">If you are serious about creating<a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> world-class experiences (and I hope every reader is!), consider the resources that will help get the most value on the design side. As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, the collection of specialists you need goes beyond the typical software team. Let’s explore their contributions briefly, as this is not the usual team organization for traditional software development.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B21964_010_07.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre4"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="calibre3">Figure 1.7 – It takes a village to build a solution</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Writing comes into play fundamentally because we have an assumption in the enterprise design space that there are materials, FAQs, articles, manuals, help, installation processes, and bug fixes, which might not be easily accessible to the Internet. This material will be added to a private ChatGPT instance so that a paying customer will get value. We hope the business employs writers and editors to create high-quality content. How this is written, ingested, and represented in ChatGPT will reflect strongly on how well it was written originally (quality in will help with quality out). Designers must help understand the goals, design tools, and even integrations that might optimize the user’s experience. Should a customer answer 15 questions individually or use a form to see the chunks of questions and answers contextually? We must design the experiences to match the problem we need to solve (the use case). In complex environments, where technical language or even multiple written or verbal languages are expected, linguists will be part of the team to help train and improve communication. Writers and linguists are also crucial in setting the style and tone of the conversation. We will dive into this in more detail later.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Finally, let’s not leave off <em class="italic">user research</em>. Besides reviewing logs<a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> and analyzing the product’s use, researchers can work with customers to learn more about how they want to use the assistant, where and when they will likely call on it, and how they will interact with it. These learnings are valuable for plotting a strategic direction and can help fix tactical issues. We will provide a set of heuristics that can be used to put on your research hat to understand where problems will arise and how to classify them.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This is just on the design side. We know that a team of engineers, product managers, quality engineers, and others will be involved in the journey. They can also benefit from this book. Do share it. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so always keep learning. The best way to keep learning is not to relearn something we already know from the history of conversational AI.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, we now know who should<a id="_idIndexMarker045" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> be involved in this process, and we understand that OpenAI’s ChatGPT is foundational, but there is still one missing piece. Why is there a need for a custom version of ChatGPT? Because proprietary data and custom answers are unavailable in a worldly-trained ChatGPT instance. Let’s explore how to add unique content by setting up a personalized ChatGPT instance.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor028" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting up a customized model</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">So now we have a sense<a id="_idIndexMarker046" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> of the people and tools we need. One more piece of the puzzle is the content that will make a ChatGPT solution valuable. There are many ways to include content in an LLM, such as ChatGPT. However, we assume a focus on unique, proprietary content hidden behind a secure paywall or available only to authenticated users. If company answers are already out in the world and answered by the basic ChatGPT, ask yourself, <em class="italic">How would my custom version of ChatGPT provide value?</em> We can help get that answer by focusing our content discussions on building a private model and including company data without sharing it with the world.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The idea of <em class="italic">enterprise</em> assistants is precisely that. Ensure company data is only exposed to customers and that adding it to an instance of ChatGPT does not expose the data to the world. Only some people were this careful when ChatGPT was first introduced. Don’t add sensitive data to a model used by competitors or to be a doctor and accidentally break patient confidentiality. The enterprise market demands security. Look at this article to go a little deeper:</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119052608/https:/www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/employees-feeding-sensitive-business-data-chatgpt-raising-security-fears" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Feeding Sensitive Data to ChatGPT</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119052608/https:/www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/employees-feeding-sensitive-business-data-chatgpt-raising-security-fears" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://web.archive.org/web/20240119052608/https:/www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/employees-feeding-sensitive-business-data-chatgpt-raising-security-fears</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s make a simple request and see how adding data dramatically changes the landscape for answers. I will set up a ChatGPT assistant in the Playground for this example. I am selecting the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model because it supports “Retrieval” and allows me to upload my files. Retrieval means I can share content with the AI so it can answer based on the information I provide. This sets enterprise solutions apart from our day-to-day use of public conversational assistants. An enterprise solution knows things that are specific to the enterprise. For this example, everything can be done from the Playground user interface. We don’t need to set up or run any code. You will need a free account to run this. Don’t upload content you are not comfortable sharing.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Newer models, like Chat GPT 40-mini, are always becoming available; use the latest models in your playground. In my example, I included a 200-page document (a draft of my Master’s thesis on interface design). This material is not easily accessed online, so we can see how results change based on its inclusion.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Uploading this document<a id="_idIndexMarker047" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> took only a few seconds, and the model was ready to answer. Of course, adding thousands or a million files is very different. Still, I want to share a sense of this power and ChatGPT’s innate ability to prioritize uploaded content over the base model. Follow along using my example content, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.8</em>.</p>

							<ol class="calibre12">
								<li class="calibre8">Visual inconsistencies: These involve inconsistencies in the visual elements of the UI, such as font styles, colors, layouts, and spacing. For example, buttons or icons that are different sizes or have inconsistent spacing could create visual inconsistencies.</li>
								<li class="calibre8">Interaction inconsistencies: These occur when the behavior of UI elements, such as buttons, links, or menus, is inconsistent across different parts of the application. For instance, inconsistent hover effects or different ways of navigating between screens can create confusion for users.</li>

						<td class="no-table-style2">
							<p class="calibre3">In a study regarding inconsistencies in user interface (UI) designs, various types of inconsistencies were identified, including physical location inconsistencies, syntactic inconsistencies, semantic inconsistencies, and feedback inconsistencies. The study found that subjects had an easier time identifying physical location inconsistencies in the interface, and that the number of physical location inconsistencies seeded in the different versions of the application was higher than other types of inconsistencies. Additionally, it was observed that different groups of subjects found varying numbers of inconsistencies in their versions of the interface, even when the seeded number of inconsistencies was almost identical across groups[1].</p>
							<p class="calibre3">This suggests that inconsistencies in UI designs can manifest in different ways, including visual, interaction, naming and labeling, functional, and platform-specific inconsistencies as mentioned earlier, but the study further highlights specific types of inconsistencies identified in a research context.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Now, this is pretty good, even without reading the 200 pages of the document. Here are some highlights at this early stage of our discussion:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">It prioritized the answer from the file over the generic <em class="italic">Internet</em> answer.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">It summarized it somewhat, including referencing it as a <em class="italic">study</em>.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Although not shown, it had difficulty showing tables and detailed results.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">It was easy to extend ChatGPT with novel content.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">It was available <em class="italic">instantly</em>. This should indicate that one can leverage these models to make them custom and unique for customers.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Notice the results included a reference citation [1] but didn’t provide a reference. This is a little bit of a hallucination. We will cover this in the book.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Notice that the first answer is a numbered list, while the second is a paragraph. We can only get consistent results if we specify how we want the results (see <a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Prompt Engineering</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">We did this example, and I encourage<a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> you to try this yourself. This shows the basics of asking ChatGPT to prioritize enterprise data over what it knows in the base-trained model. We will go much further with this in the coming chapters.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">OpenAI supports basic retrieval</p>
			<p class="callout">On their knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> page (December 2023), OpenAI said, “<em class="italic">Retrieval of content in this example is optimized for quality by adding all the content to the model calls. In the future, ChatGPT will introduce other strategies to help optimize the trade-off between quality </em><em class="italic">and cost.</em>”</p>
			<p class="callout">Here is one of those strategies:</p>
			<p class="callout">Article: <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">File Search from OpenAI</a> (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you read about OpenAI retrieval, it has significant limitations and costs that might hinder an enterprise solution. Other parts of generative AI solutions can address scale. This is covered in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content </em><em class="italic">is King</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">At this point, this only scratches the surface. We will go into how to develop a user research plan and apply standard research methods to the conversational world, then dive deep into user interface patterns, guidelines, and heuristics to help guide and improve the quality of an enterprise ChatGPT solution. Once we have something, it is time to apply our care and feeding approaches to monitor and improve the quality of customer experiences, extending it further into more customer use cases with the quality they expect. We will wrap it all up in a nice bow so this newfound expertise can be shared with your friends in development and product management. No person is an island. It does take a team.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Next, let’s cover basic research and tools we can use to understand our users and how we can learn what our customers need. A few suitable research methods can go a long way to bridging the gap for unknown unknowns…</p>
			<p class="author-quote">“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.”</p>
