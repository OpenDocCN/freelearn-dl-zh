     Introduction to generative AI

   </h1>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">
     Generative AI refers to a class of AI technologies that is capable of generating various forms of content, including but not limited to text, images, audio, and video.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">
     These AI systems can
    </span>
    <a id="_idIndexMarker003">
    </a>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">
     generate new content, based on their training data and input parameters, which usually include text prompts but can also involve other forms of input such as images.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">
     The recent buzz around generative AI comes from the simplicity with which new user interfaces powered by this AI technology can create high-quality text, graphics, and videos
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">
      in seconds.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">
     In very simple terms, generative AI is about making new data that looks like the data from which it has been trained.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">
     In other words, learning the underlying patterns, structures, and distributions of input data enables a procedure within the model allowing it to generate new data in a similar way.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">
     For instance, if trained on a dataset of human faces, a generative AI model will be able to create completely new faces of people that don’t actually exist in real life but are very realistic.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">
     In essence, generative AI models work by learning the probability distribution of a dataset and then sampling from that distribution to create new instances.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.5">
     This approach is different from discriminative models, whose goal is to learn how to tell classes of data apart.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.6">
     For example, a discriminative model could be trained to separate pictures of cats and dogs, but a generative model would be trained to make up completely new pictures of cats
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">
      or dogs.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">
     The concept of generative AI goes a long way back; in fact, it dates back to the time when machine learning was in its cradle.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">
     However, it is only recently that this field has come under the limelight due to neural networks and drastic improvements in computing power over the last 10 years.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">
     In the early attempts at generative modeling—Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models—many simpler statistical techniques were involved.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">
     Methods of modeling arbitrary complex data distributions have much higher potential compatibility with the kinds of methods that were previously dominant but have recently been overcome by deep learning.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">
     Deep learning was therefore a watershed development for the field of generative AI.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.6">
     Models, such as VAEs, which started appearing around the beginning of the 2010s, were able to leverage deep neural networks to model more complex data distributions.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.7">
     Around that same period, GANs were proposed; for the first time, they offered a new way for two neural networks to work together to create data, using principles from game theory.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.8">
     In a general sense, these breakthroughs took leaps toward the possibilities of making real, high-quality, realistic creation

   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">
     This can lead to innovation in most fields across industries, such as healthcare, finance, education, travel and hospitality, manufacturing, and more.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">
     Generative AI in creative industries helps artists and designers think outside the box, helping with the conception of new and innovative content.

     It opens ways for new routes of drug discovery and personalized medicine in health.

   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">
     One of the most popular generative models is the VAE.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">
     The core idea behind VAE consists of
    </span>
    <a id="_idIndexMarker006">
    </a>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">
     learning a probabilistic mapping between data and a latent space, and vice versa.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">
     This means learning how
    </span>
    <a id="_idIndexMarker007">
    </a>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">
     to convert real data into a simplified representation (such as a compressed form) and then back again into data that looks real.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">
     VAEs are designed to ensure a high likelihood of the data while preserving a well-structured latent space to enable the generation of new data samples similar to the training data.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">
     Some of the most common flavors of VAE are

     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">
      It gives a framework for generating new samples out of the learned latent space.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">
      The VAE is a generative model that learns to compress and reconstruct data while also learning a probability distribution of the latent space.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">
      In simpler terms, a VAE is like a clever algorithm that learns to understand and recreate data.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">
      Imagine it as a skilled artist who can compress a detailed painting into a simple sketch (encoding) and then recreate the full painting from that sketch (decoding).
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.6">
      What makes VAEs special is that they don’t just copy data but also learn the essence of it, allowing them to create new, similar data.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.7">
      This is like an artist learning not just to copy specific paintings but also to understand the style so well that they can paint new, original works in that style.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.8">
      In real life, VAEs have been used in many creative ways.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.9">
      For instance, in drug discovery, VAEs have been used to generate novel molecular structures.
     </span>

      This is similar to teaching an art student to not just copy a painting but also to understand and separate the key elements such as color, shape, and style.

      In these cases, the agent-based system can act on specific tasks using tools (such as calling a flight booking API) simply by understanding the context of the conversation that the customer is having with the chatbot.

      More advanced agent-based systems often come into play when discussing robotics, where a robot’s actions are primarily controlled by agents.

      The robotic agent essentially determines what decisions to make based on its environment or the specific task it is assigned to perform.
     </span>
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.7">
      It uses agents to execute actions that an LLM would otherwise be unable to perform; for example, an agent can turn on or off the limb actuators of a robot.

     This is especially problematic if the models are trained on large amounts of private or proprietary information.

     These prompting techniques are not sophisticated and often make it a very easy, cost-effective attack vector to get a model to leak information.

     The leaked information includes people’s names, email and physical addresses, and phone numbers that were inadvertently present in the model’s training dataset.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">
     Some of the common mechanisms to mitigate this is to perform data anonymization or pseudonymization on the training data to remove or obscure personal, private, and or proprietary information, even before training the model.
