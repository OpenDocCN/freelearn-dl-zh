     Introduction to generative AI
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Generative AI refers to a class of AI technologies that is capable of generating various forms of content, including but not limited to text, images, audio, and video.
    
    
     These AI systems can
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker003">
    </a>
    
     generate new content, based on their training data and input parameters, which usually include text prompts but can also involve other forms of input such as images.
    
    
     The recent buzz around generative AI comes from the simplicity with which new user interfaces powered by this AI technology can create high-quality text, graphics, and videos
    
    
     
      in seconds.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In very simple terms, generative AI is about making new data that looks like the data from which it has been trained.
    
    
     In other words, learning the underlying patterns, structures, and distributions of input data enables a procedure within the model allowing it to generate new data in a similar way.
    
    
     For instance, if trained on a dataset of human faces, a generative AI model will be able to create completely new faces of people that don’t actually exist in real life but are very realistic.
    
    
     In essence, generative AI models work by learning the probability distribution of a dataset and then sampling from that distribution to create new instances.
    
    
     This approach is different from discriminative models, whose goal is to learn how to tell classes of data apart.
    
    
     For example, a discriminative model could be trained to separate pictures of cats and dogs, but a generative model would be trained to make up completely new pictures of cats
    
    
     
      or dogs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The concept of generative AI goes a long way back; in fact, it dates back to the time when machine learning was in its cradle.
    
    
     However, it is only recently that this field has come under the limelight due to neural networks and drastic improvements in computing power over the last 10 years.
    
    
     In the early attempts at generative modeling—Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models—many simpler statistical techniques were involved.
    
    
     Methods of modeling arbitrary complex data distributions have much higher potential compatibility with the kinds of methods that were previously dominant but have recently been overcome by deep learning.
    
    
     Deep learning was therefore a watershed development for the field of generative AI.
    
    
     Models, such as VAEs, which started appearing around the beginning of the 2010s, were able to leverage deep neural networks to model more complex data distributions.
    
    
     Around that same period, GANs were proposed; for the first time, they offered a new way for two neural networks to work together to create data, using principles from game theory.
    
    
     In a general sense, these breakthroughs took leaps toward the possibilities of making real, high-quality, realistic creation
    
    
     
      of data.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     This can lead to innovation in most fields across industries, such as healthcare, finance, education, travel and hospitality, manufacturing, and more.
    
    
     Generative AI in creative industries helps artists and designers think outside the box, helping with the conception of new and innovative content.
    
    
     It opens ways for new routes of drug discovery and personalized medicine in health.
    
    
     In the business world, generative AI works by providing efficient and effective customer engagement through personalized content and experiences.
    
    
     The
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker004">
    </a>
    
     other point involves questioning one’s own stance regarding creativity and originality: when machines are able to pump out very similar material, one is automatically forced to think about what creativity is, who the artist really is, and what the ethical parameters should be for
    
    
     
      AI-created content.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Having understood what generative AI is and its brief history, let’s explore the different types of generative
    
    
     
      AI models.

     Types of generative AI models
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Generative AI is an exciting domain of AI that deals with the generation of new, synthetic
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker005">
    </a>
    
     data by learning patterns from existing datasets, aiming to generate outputs that share similar statistical properties and characteristics with the training data.
    
    
     Here is a broad overview of some of the most prominent types of generative models: VAEs, GANs, and
    
    
     
      autoregressive models.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-22">
    <a id="_idTextAnchor021">
    </a>
    
     VAEs
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     One of the most popular generative models is the VAE.
    
    
     The core idea behind VAE consists of
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker006">
    </a>
    
     learning a probabilistic mapping between data and a latent space, and vice versa.
    
    
     This means learning how
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker007">
    </a>
    
     to convert real data into a simplified representation (such as a compressed form) and then back again into data that looks real.
    
    
     VAEs are designed to ensure a high likelihood of the data while preserving a well-structured latent space to enable the generation of new data samples similar to the training data.
    
    
     Some of the most common flavors of VAE are
    
    
     
      as follows:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       VAE
      
     </strong>
     
      : The basic model that compresses and reconstructs data.
     
     
      It gives a framework for generating new samples out of the learned latent space.
     
     
      The VAE is a generative model that learns to compress and reconstruct data while also learning a probability distribution of the latent space.
     
     
      In simpler terms, a VAE is like a clever algorithm that learns to understand and recreate data.
     
     
      Imagine it as a skilled artist who can compress a detailed painting into a simple sketch (encoding) and then recreate the full painting from that sketch (decoding).
     
     
      What makes VAEs special is that they don’t just copy data but also learn the essence of it, allowing them to create new, similar data.
     
     
      This is like an artist learning not just to copy specific paintings but also to understand the style so well that they can paint new, original works in that style.
     
     
      In real life, VAEs have been used in many creative ways.
     
     
      For instance, in drug discovery, VAEs have been used to generate novel molecular structures.
     
     
      Researchers at AstraZeneca used VAEs to explore chemical space and propose new drug-like molecules with desired properties, potentially accelerating the drug development
     
     
      
       process [1].
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Beta-VAE
      
     </strong>
     
      : An extension of VAE that introduces a hyperparameter to control explicitly the trade-off between the reconstruction quality and the disentanglement of the latent space.
     
     
      The model undertakes the creation of more
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker008">
     </a>
     
      interpretable disentangled representations.
     
     
      In simpler terms, Beta-VAE is like a more flexible version of the original VAE.
     
     
      It allows researchers to adjust how much the model focuses on recreating exact details versus understanding the underlying features of the data.
     
     
      This is similar to teaching an art student to not just copy a painting but also to understand and separate the key elements such as color, shape, and style.
     
     
      This ability to
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       disentangle
      
     </em>
     
      features makes Beta-VAE particularly useful in fields such as computer vision and robotics.
     
     
      For example, researchers have used Beta-VAE to teach robots to understand objects better.
     
     
      By learning to separate features such as size, color, and position, robots can more easily recognize and manipulate objects in different situations, making them more adaptable and efficient in various
     
     
      
       tasks [2].
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Conditional variational autoencoder
      
     </strong>
     
      (
     
     <strong class="bold">
      
       CVAE
      
     </strong>
     
      ): A variant that conditions the generation process on some extra information, typically class labels, producing not just data similar to the training set but also samples that can then be drawn from specific classes .
     
     
      Think of CVAE as a more controlled version of VAE, like an artist who can paint in different styles on demand.
     
     
      Instead of just creating random new paintings, this artist can be told to “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       Paint a landscape
      
     </em>
     
      ” or “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       Paint a portrait
      
     </em>
     
      ” and they’ll create new art in that specific category.
     
     
      This added control makes CVAE very useful in practical applications.
     
     
      For instance, in the
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker009">
     </a>
     
      field of computer games, CVAE has been used for game development and procedural content generation with the generation of game elements such as character design, level layouts, music and sound effects, and so on.
     
     
      By providing different conditions such as “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       Create a forest level
      
     </em>
     
      ” or “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       Create a desert level
      
     </em>
     
      ,” the CVAE can produce a wide variety of game environments, saving time for designers and enhancing the player’s experience with more diverse and interesting game
     
     
      
       worlds [3].

   <h2 id="_idParaDest-23">

    </a>
    
     GANs
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     A GAN is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker010">
    </a>
    
     basically formed by two neural networks: a
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      generator
     
    </strong>
    
     and a
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      discriminator
     
    </strong>
    
     .
    
    
     The generator generates synthetic data samples; the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker011">
    </a>
    
     other trained
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker012">
    </a>
    
     neural network
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker013">
    </a>
    
     should then be able to tell the difference between real and created samples.
    
    
     While training these networks, they are trained together antagonistically: the generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries rightly to classify real versus fake data.
    
    
     In this competition, the generator gets better and better at faking data.
    
    
     The following are some of the different types
    
    
     
      of GANs:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       GAN
      
     </strong>
     
      : The basic model in which the generator and discriminator are trained adversarially; it is the root model for most innovations in generative modeling.
     
     
      As explained earlier, you can imagine GAN as a game between two players—a counterfeiter (generator) trying to create fake money, and a detective (discriminator) trying to identify the fakes.
     
     
      As they compete, they both get better at their jobs, which means that the counterfeiter gets increasingly better at creating fake money.
     
     
      This clever setup allows GANs to create incredibly realistic fake data, such as images or
     
     
      
       sounds [4].
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Deep convolutional GAN
      
     </strong>
     
      (
     
     <strong class="bold">
      
       DCGAN
      
     </strong>
     
      ): This is a refinement of the base GAN model with deep convolutional neural networks; at the moment, it is one of the best architectures for generating images of high quality.
     
     
      Think of DCGAN as a more sophisticated artist compared to the basic GAN.
     
     
      It’s like upgrading from simple sketching tools to a full digital art studio, allowing for the creation of much more detailed and realistic images.
     
     
      DCGANs are particularly good at understanding and recreating complex patterns in
     
     
      
       images [5].
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Wasserstein GAN
      
     </strong>
     
      (
     
     <strong class="bold">
      
       WGAN
      
     </strong>
     
      ): This proposes a different loss function with the Wasserstein distance.
     
     
      This removes problems while training with a GAN, hence making training more stable and improving sample quality.
     
     
      This helps measure the distance between two probability distributions better.
     
     
      WGAN is like giving the
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker014">
     </a>
     
      artist (generator) and critic (discriminator) in a GAN a better way to communicate and evaluate
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker015">
     </a>
     
      each other’s work.
     
     
      Instead of just saying “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       good
      
     </em>
     
      ” or “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       bad
      
     </em>
     
      ,” they can now give more nuanced feedback, such as “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       You’re getting warmer
      
     </em>
     
      ” or “
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       You’re way off
      
     </em>
     
      .”
     
     
      This leads to more consistent improvement and high-quality results.
     
     
      In practical applications, WGANs have been used in medical imaging to generate synthetic medical images for training purposes.
     
     
      This helps in creating larger, more diverse datasets for training diagnostic AI systems, potentially improving their accuracy in detecting diseases from scans and
     
     
      
       X-rays [6].

      The model is especially good at handling style and content separately.
     
     
      Progressions offered by the introductions of StyleGAN2 and StyleGAN3 are still aimed at improving image fidelity and realism.
     
     
      Think of StyleGAN as an advanced digital artist that can not only create realistic images but also mix and match different styles and contents.
     
     
      It’s like having a painter who can take the style of Van Gogh and apply it to a modern cityscape.
     
     
      This flexibility makes StyleGAN incredibly

     These models, often trained on vast amounts of open web text and other freely available text data, have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text across diverse applications, showcasing their versatility and advanced linguistic abilities.
    
    
     Examples of LLMs include GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM, and BERT-large.
    
    
     These models have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in NLP, showing proficiency in tasks ranging from question-answering and summarization to creative writing and code generation.

      Multimodal LLMs can process and generate content in various modalities such as text, image, audio, video, and any combination thereof.
     
     
      These models are rather novel in nature and recent advancements in compute have made it possible to train multimodal LLMs.
     
     
      Some of the well-known multimodal LLMs are DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Flamingo, GPT-4,

      As such, in certain scenarios, these models may not perform effectively for tasks that use data that the model has never seen before and thus may fail to follow the user intent.
     
     
      For example, a manufacturing manual for a proprietary instrument may contain domain-specific proprietary language, which the model may not have been exposed to during training.
     
     
      In such cases, LLMs can be fine-tuned using the domain-specific data to follow specific instructions and prompts (that is, text input to the model).
     
     
      This special fine-tuning enables the model to perform domain-specific tasks on which the model was fine-tuned, in addition to its other capabilities.
     
     
      Think of this as localizing a personal copy of a model to be good at performing a task that is meaningful for your
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker039">

      use case.
     
     
      One of the common examples of such a model is InstructGPT, where researchers fine-tuned the GPT-3 model on specific instructions.
     
     
      These types of models are used in a multitude of different tasks such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and
     
     
      
       task-specific applications.

      While instruction-tuned LLMs are an avenue to make these general-purpose models work for domain-specific tasks, researchers have innovated on training domain-specific LLMs from the ground up.
     
     
      This means that these models were pre-trained on highly specialized, domain knowledge.
     
     
      For example, the BioBERT model is trained on hyper-specialized medical data, whereas LegalBERT is trained on legal documents.
     
     
      These models are useful for specialized tasks in specific fields such as medicine, law,

     On the surface, this example looks pretty straightforward.
    
    
     However, there are a number of things
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker054">
    </a>
    
     that are happening in the background.
    
    
     Firstly, the customer starts with a vague request to book a flight.
    
    
     The AI assistant
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker055">
    </a>
    
     understands that in order to proceed with this request, it needs a few more pieces of information to look up available flights, such as departure/arrival city, dates of travel, and
    
    
     
      so on.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     As the conversation progresses, the AI assistant requests further pieces of information to be able to successfully complete the booking.
    
    
     The information it gathers at each step is used as a parameter value to call flight booking-related APIs in the backend; for example, city/travel dates/number of passengers are required to look up available flight information using a (fictitious) API named
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      flightLookup
     
    </strong>
    
     , customer name/phone/email are required to actually make the booking using an API named b
    
    <strong class="bold">

     gives an overview of the decisions that the model makes, the flow of the interaction, and the tools (API functions) it calls to complete
    
    
     
      each step:

   <p>
    
     In addition
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker056">
    </a>
    
     to just tool calling, you will also
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker057">
    </a>
    
     notice that the model does a bit of introspection, also known as
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      chain of thought
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      CoT
     
    </strong>
    
     ), at the beginning of the conversation.
    
    
     This means the model in the backend crafts a step-by-step approach to complete the task but identifies some missing information.
    
    
     It then responds back to the customer with a request to provide the required information.
    
    
     Subsequently, based on the input from the customer, it makes certain decisions autonomously to call specific tools using the agent and completes
    
    
     
      the task.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In addition to the external tools and APIs, there are a number of other things to consider when designing such a system.
    
    
     We will cover the fundamentals of each of these components in detail in the subsequent chapters.
    
    
     For now, it is sufficient to know that agents are
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker058">
    </a>
    
     an advanced application of LLMs (such as this travel booking AI assistant) and represent an emerging field that combines
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker059">
    </a>
    
     aspects of various LLM types with additional AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, planning, and tool use.
    
    
     As you learn more in subsequent chapters, you will notice that agents are designed to be more interactive, adaptable, and capable of completing complex, multi-step tasks compared to standard LLMs, which makes them suitable for a variety of different complex tasks
    
    
     
      and workflows.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     But before we dive deeper into the details of agentic systems, let us review some of the applications of
    
    
     
      generative AI.

     Applications of generative AI
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Generative AI has innovation capabilities that cover a diverse set of fields.
    
    
     As discussed earlier, industries
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker060">
    </a>
    
     such as healthcare, finance, education, media and entertainment, marketing, manufacturing, retail, and so on all have the potential to benefit from generative AI capabilities.
    
    
     The following is a survey of only a few of the primary applications of
    
    
     
      generative AI:

     <a id="_idIndexMarker061">
     </a>
     
      can handle images, text, audio, and videos) are making it possible to generate realistic audio/visuals through various platforms and tools.
     
     
      For example, in media and entertainment, generative AI can help in generating visual effects, designing avatars, and developing virtual reality content.
     
     
      In the fashion and design industry, it is being used to conceptualize new clothing designs, prepare virtual fashion shows, and make fashion trend predictions.
     
     
      In marketing ads and promotion space, generative AI is being used to generate tailor-made advertisements, campaigns, marketing communications, and other marketing materials creatives such as images
     
     
      
       and logos.

      : Generative AI has made significant strides when it
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker062">
     </a>
     
      comes to text-based tasks.
     
     
      For instance, content writing such as rapid and hassle-free generation of articles, blog posts, marketing, and product copies are already some of the most common use cases.
     
     
      Chatbots and virtual assistants are providing customer support in a very humanlike manner to information-related inquiries.
     
     
      Generative AI is also assisting in text translation, document summarization, and content localization for increased accessibility of content for platforms such as online learning and specialized
     
     
      
       search engines.

     <strong class="bold">
      
       IDEs

      (
     
     <strong class="bold">

      ), that can understand
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker067">
     </a>
     
      the entire context of the code base, identify errors, create code documentation, and generate unit test scripts.
     
     
      Another implementation of code generation is text-to-query use cases where a natural
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker068">
     </a>
     
      language prompt is converted into a SQL query, which can then be executed against a database to get the desired results.
     
     
      However, this is one of the areas where special caution must be taken, especially before executing the code generated by an LLM, to prevent risks of malicious code execution.
     
     
      Often, in these situations, the code generated by the LLM is executed in a sandbox and sanitized to check whether the code is safe and appropriate for execution in an
     
     
      
       autonomous environment.

     <a id="_idIndexMarker069">
     </a>
     
      serving as their foundations.
     
     
      These agents can perform several tasks in various use cases.
     
     
      For example, a travel booking website with a virtual assistant chatbot can implement agents to automate the travel and hotel booking process for the customer.
     
     
      In these cases, the agent-based system can act on specific tasks using tools (such as calling a flight booking API) simply by understanding the context of the conversation that the customer is having with the chatbot.
     
     
      More advanced agent-based systems often come into play when discussing robotics, where a robot’s actions are primarily controlled by agents.
     
     
      The robotic agent essentially determines what decisions to make based on its environment or the specific task it is assigned to perform.
     
     
      It uses agents to execute actions that an LLM would otherwise be unable to perform; for example, an agent can turn on or off the limb actuators of a robot.
     
     
      AI in robotics is a novel and open field of research, with numerous innovations emerging in the industry, particularly targeted toward
     
     
      
       manufacturing applications.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     These are just some of the common examples of the uses of generative AI with LLMs.
    
    
     Other specific examples include uses in fashion and design, synthetic data generation, personalized educational content, financial modeling and forecasting, and predictive maintenance.

     Challenges and limitations of generative AI
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Though
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker075">
    </a>
    
     generative AI has immense benefits, it is not without its own set of challenges and limitations.
    
    
     Some of these challenges and limitations need to be taken into account with a lot of caution while considering a generative AI technology for any particular use case.
    
    
     Here’s a brief discussion of some of the most common caveats related to LLMs and some of the ways to
    
    
     
      mitigate them.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-28">
    <a id="_idTextAnchor027">
    </a>
    
     Quality of data and bias
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     The generative models are largely aided by the quality and diversity of data in the training dataset.
    
    
     Any model trained with biased or unrepresentative data will reproduce outputs with
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker076">
    </a>
    
     the same kind of bias, hence solidifying existing biases or allowing marginalization of one or several groups in case of bias in the
    
    
     
      training data.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     One way this challenge can be dealt with is by ensuring richness in diversity, good quality data, and so on for a wide array of perspectives within the dataset itself used for training.
    
    
     As with any machine learning problem, analysis of the data and knowing the data distribution across features is often helpful.
    
    
     Data analysis can reveal imbalances that can introduce bias in the model.
    
    
     There are several algorithmic ways of mitigating bias in training data (for instance, using oversampling or undersampling), but each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages.
    
    
     For example, consider two classes of data in a training dataset that contains more instances of
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Class 0
     
    </em>
    
     data than
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Class 1
     
    </em>
    
     data, causing a natural imbalance in the dataset.
    
    
     When a model is trained with such a dataset, the model would “overfit” on the
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Class 0
     
    </em>
    
     type of data and would become more proficient in or even memorize data that belongs to
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Class 0
     
    </em>
    
     and may not perform well for data belonging to
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Class 1
     
    </em>
    
     This inherently causes the model to perform poorly and demonstrate heavy bias.
    
    
     The following figure demonstrates the effect of oversampling and undersampling on such a dataset to
    
    
     
      mitigate bias:

     Data privacy
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Multiple experiments and researchers have proven that LLMs have a propensity to leak data they
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker077">
    </a>
    
     are trained on.
    
    
     This is especially problematic if the models are trained on large amounts of private or proprietary information.
    
    
     Special techniques and styles of prompting LLMs have shown that it is sufficient to coerce the model to generate data that includes verbatim text from its training dataset.
    
    
     These prompting techniques are not sophisticated and often make it a very easy, cost-effective attack vector to get a model to leak information.
    
    
     For example, as discussed in the paper named
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Scalable Extraction of Training Data from (Production) Language Models
     
    </em>
    
     [15], researchers were able to spend only $200 worth of API calls to OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model and use prompt injection techniques to coerce the model to leak private information.
    
    
     The leaked information includes people’s names, email and physical addresses, and phone numbers that were inadvertently present in the model’s training dataset.
    
    
     While some of these issues are actively being addressed by model providers such as OpenAI, it can still be problematic for organizations that choose to train their own
    
    
     
      models in-house.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Some of the common mechanisms to mitigate this is to perform data anonymization or pseudonymization on the training data to remove or obscure personal, private, and or proprietary information, even before training the model.
    
    
     Both of these techniques involved
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker078">
    </a>
    
     using smaller, cheaper, and faster AI models to perform classification and entity detection to identify the presence of personal or private data in the training dataset.
    
    
     Once identified, the private information can be obscured, masked, or entirely removed from the training dataset.
    
    
     Note that there could be several implications to doing this depending on your use case, so special analysis must be performed to ensure that it doesn’t impact the
    
    
     
      model’s performance.

     Computational resources
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Training sophisticated generative models is very resource-intensive and requires high computational power; this often makes it economically cost-prohibitive and energy-consuming
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker079">
    </a>
    
     to train large language models.
    
    
     Although there have been several hardware breakthroughs that make it possible to train such models, access to these hardware assets still remains expensive, privileged, and
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker080">
    </a>
    
     limited.
    
    
     For example,
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      graphics processing units
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      GPUs
     
    </strong>
    
     ), initially designed for rendering high-fidelity graphics, have become crucial for AI model training, fine-tuning, and computations.
    
    
     NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture, introduced in 2006, allowed GPUs to be used for general-purpose computing, and modern GPUs such as NVIDIA’s A100 and H100 have since been specifically optimized for AI workloads.
    
    
     However, these high-end GPUs can often cost tens of thousands of dollars
    
    
     
      per unit.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Training large models such as GPT-3 is estimated to cost millions of dollars in compute resources alone.
    
    
     The exact cost depends on factors such as model size, training duration, and hardware efficiency.
    
    
     For example, training GPT-3 was estimated to cost around $4–5 million in compute resources, and more recent models such as GPT-4 and PaLM are likely even more expensive to train.
    
    
     Beyond the hardware itself, there are significant infrastructure costs related to power consumption, cooling, and data center space.
    
    
     Due to the high costs, training large language models is primarily done by large tech companies or well-funded research institutions.
    
    
     Cloud services now offer access to pre-trained models and fine-tuning capabilities, making some level of LLM work more accessible to smaller organizations and the general public.
    
    
     A way to overcome this challenge
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker081">
    </a>
    
     can be found in recent innovations with

    <a id="_idIndexMarker082">
    </a>
    
     AI models that can be trained to achieve specific tasks.
    
    
     Even though these models are limited to a very narrow set of domain-specific tasks, it is much more economical to train these models since they require far fewer
    
    
     
      computational resources.

      If that were to happen, it would yield deepfakes or even misinformation, which could be a threat to privacy, security, or even
     
     
      
       public trust.

       Intellectual property

      The legal complexity attached to the very originality of the creation and correct ownership can be

      Of concern is the fact that resultant effects are expected to be paralleled with studies on ways of reskilling and adjustment strategies that can help the affected workers, as well as
     
     
      
       entrepreneurial opportunities.

   <p>
    
     When it comes to mitigating social and ethical implications, the question is more philosophical than technical.
    
    
     While some measures such as deepfake AI image detection and private and personal data detection methods are common strategies, the societal implications are a larger question in the context of AI’s benefit to society and any existing or impending
    
    
     
      government regulations.

     Generalization and creativity

     One of the big problems with these generative AI models is that their generalization ability turns
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker084">
    </a>
    
     out to be very poor.
    
    
     More concretely, they seldom generate content that is strikingly different from the training data.
    
    
     That is, they are brilliant at copying the repeating patterns but fail really to create something original or novel.
    
    
     As a consequence, their potential for capital

     Summary
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Generative AI is a rather rapidly growing area, having huge disruptive potential for industries and changing areas of our lives.
    
    
     In contrast, applications of generative AI include very realistic image generation and generation of text, accelerated drug discovery, and enriched
    
    
     
      creative expression.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     One of the key points regarding this is an understanding of the different generative models, such as VAEs, GANs, and autoregressive models, that provide insight into how technologies work and where they can be applied.
    
    
     It would also, however, be important to state the many problems and limitations generative AI faces, including data quality, computational resources, ethical considerations, and
    
    
     
      even creativity.
