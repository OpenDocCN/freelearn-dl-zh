<p class="mce-root">This section, composed of three chapters, will take you on a little journey on the whole process of creating a Behavior Tree, from Design to Implementation. In particular, a concrete example is shown (crafted in such way that we will need to use almost all the skills learnt in the previous chapters), thus giving you the possibility to get some practice.</p>
<p>The following chapters will be covered in this section:</p>
