    language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, is and how this technology has transformed
    not only generative AI but also the industries and services that have already
    deployed generative AI solutions or are planning to do so. You learned that since
    its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm and has quickly
    become a household word. By May 2023, 70% of the world’s organizations were already
    exploring the benefits of **generative AI**, in general and in models, including
    ChatGPT.

    generative AI, current best practices, and implementation strategies to ensure
    robust security measures. We will address potential vulnerabilities, privacy concerns,
    and the need to protect user data. The chapter discusses privacy, access controls,
    and authentication mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information. It also emphasizes
    the significance of regular security audits, expanding on the concept of monitoring
    that we learned about in the previous chapter, as well as incident response procedures.
    By implementing these security practices, organizations can mitigate risks, protect
    business and user privacy, and ensure the safe and trustworthy use of ChatGPT
    in real-world applications.

    have the experience to provide the proper guardrails for or projection against
    the LLMs they create (fine-tuned). As the resources required to create/train any
    models can be quite large, if there is a security threat or attack against these
    LLMs, the application or service (depending on the LLM) can lead to service interruptions
    that are very similar to the original DoS cyber attacks on computers and networks.

    input limit, such as a token limit imposed by each model alone, may not help.
    As a best practice, we advise placing a resource limit to ensure excessive requests
    do not consume a majority or all resources, such as memory constraints, either
    inadvertently or intentionally. These resource limits can be placed at the prompt
    level, say, by creating a summary of a prompt first before sending this to another
    LLM, such as ChatGPT, for further processing (recall that this is LLM chaining),
    as well as at the cloud service level.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both jailbreaks and direct/indirect prompt injections are another attack against
    LLMs. These two types of attacks are very closely related; with jailbreak, an
    attacker can comprise a model by creating a specialized and unique prompt in such
    a way that this prompt would bypass any protection and guardrails put in place
    by the content safety regulations (more on content filtering later), thus allowing
    the prompt, or any subsequent prompts, to behave and respond in a way that normally
    wouldn’t be allowed. We’ll provide an example shortly after we define prompt injection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With prompt injection, which is very similar to a jailbreak, it’s purpose is
    to mislead the LLM to respond in a way it should not and do something it shouldn’t
    be doing, such as **execute** an arbitrary task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an analogy to prompt injection, some of our readers may already be working
    with technology and, specifically, database technology and, thus, be familiar
    with a security attack known as “**SQL injection**,” which is similar to prompt
    injection in that an attacker will insert or “inject” malicious SQL code or an
    SQL query to then gain access to the database or cause harm to the database system.
    For example, with an SQL injection, an attacker can run a task to gain elevated
    permissions and then bring the entire database offline. As another example, the
    attacker may gain access to sensitive data contained within the database, make
    changes to the database, or run some other malicious activity against the database.
    While we won’t go into the details of an SQL injection attack, you should be aware
    that this pattern and behavior in an SQL injection attack is similar to an LLM
    prompt injection. However, with a prompt injection, instead of an SQL database
    being the target of an attack, the target is an LLM instead. The task being executed
    could be running agents or other APIs (which you learned about in [*Chapter 6*](B21443_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117)),
    for example, to run code and cause harm.

    prompt. For example, in customer support chatbot/LLM use cases, you can have the
    plugin create an incident service ticket, such as a ServiceNow ticket, as part
    of the support interaction. What would happen if the plugin was given free rein
    and began opening thousands and thousands of support tickets? This could potentially

    these same guidelines should be followed. The guidelines vary according to the
    type of programming languages and frameworks, and they are widely publicized online,
    so ensure you are doing your due diligence to protect the execution code of your
    plugins and also protect any downstream services. A good practice, for example,
    is to rate limits on how much interaction the plugin can have with other systems,
    that is, control how much interaction a plugin can have for the downstream application.
    After all, you do not want to inadvertently cause a DoS attack by continually
    exceeding the processing rates of the downstream application or service, thus
    making the application unavailable for users. Creating an **auditing trail** of
    your plugin is also a best practice. This means that the execution code should
    log all the activity it is completing as the code is being processed. Creating
    this audit log of the plugin’s activity can serve a dual-purpose activity that
    is useful for not only ensuring the plugin is executing and completing tasks as
    it should and, thus, adhering to a secure plugin design but that the audit logs
    can also be used for troubleshooting an issue, such as slow response time(s),
    by using the plugin. Sometimes, the output of the plugin or even the LLM can take
    a long time to process or, worse, cause an insecure output, so audit logging can

    seen in the many exciting topics in this book. However, companies, organizations,
    governments, or any entities building applications and services that create or
    use LLMs need to handle this with caution and tread lightly, in the same way,
    they would if they were using a product or technology service that is still in
    beta or in its very early release. We always recommend verifying every component
    of your generative AI cloud solution or service, from the LLM itself to any relevant
    dataset or plugins used in the overall solution. Verifying and confirming each
    and every component against security risks may seem like a long, arduous task

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within most large-scale cloud services supporting generative AI, such as Microsoft
    Azure OpenAI, there are ways to apply security controls and guardrails to deal
    with potentially harmful or inappropriate material returned by generative AI models/LLMs.
    One security control is known as content filtering. As the name implies, content
    filtering is an additional feature, provided at no cost, to filter out inappropriate
    or harmful content. By implementing this rating system, unsafe content in the
    form of text and images (perhaps even voice in the near future) can be filtered
    out to prevent triggering, offensive, or unsuitable content from reaching specific
    audiences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you may already know, LLMs can generate harmful content, for example, gory
    or violent content. This can be true for even benevolent contexts and interactions.
    For example, if you wanted to do some research about a certain time period, there
    could be LLM-generated completions that may depict information about war and go
    into detail about this. Of course, the content-filtering aspect we mentioned previously
    can protect against this; however, you will need to understand if an organization
    disables/opts out of such filtering; if not, then this could expose the end users
    to details they may not feel comfortable with.

    identities and key management, which we will cover in the next section, will give

    **Azure Active Directory** (**Azure AD**) service. If you are already familiar
    with Azure AD, then you already know about Microsoft Entra ID, as this is the
    same service with a name change and new capabilities. If you are not familiar
    with Entra ID, we will not go into too much detail but know that this is the authentication
    and authorization system, and it has been around for a decade(s) for the centralized
    management of identities for Azure and many other resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Managed identities in services and resources in a cloud vendor, such as Microsoft,
    can authorize access to Azure AI service resources using Microsoft Entra ID credentials
    from applications. So, how is a managed identity different from, say, a service
    account using a **service principal** **name** (**SPN**)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An application can use a managed identity to obtain a Microsoft Entra security
    access token without having to manage the credentials, such as having to reset
    the password after some time period. Alternatively, SPNs do require the management
    of credentials, such as regularly changing the password. This additional task
    makes SPN management not as secure; for example, if one does not have a policy
    in place to enforce password changes after *x* number of days, as a managed identity
    has to automatically change passwords via the internal system process. Thus, as
    a best practice for enabling security controls, always use managed identities
    with your Azure cloud solutions whenever possible.

    however, as a best practice, these keys should be regenerated often to ensure
    older keys are removed from the system. There are always a minimum of two keys,
    so you can use either the first key or the second key with Azure OpenAI. Having
    two keys always allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without downtime
    or service outage. As a best practice, you can store these keys in a key vault,
    such as Azure Key Vault, and then limit access to the keys to only specific applications
    or services.

    data encryption, your organization can also use its own keys to add another layer

    implementing your red team operations. Nonetheless, integrating auditing and reporting
    techniques into your practice is equally crucial. These topics will be explored
    in the following section.

- en: Oftentimes, we hear words that generally may have a negative connotation around
    them. For many, the word “audit” or “auditing” could be such a word. However,
    in the case of technology, auditing is a requirement and a best practice to help
    protect an organization against potential security risks; examples of security
    risks are described earlier in this chapter. A technology audit is a review, like
    any other audit, to ensure that the organization controls put forth are in place
    and produce the results expected and/or uncover areas where there may be gaps
    in security controls and risks specific to generative AI, as described earlier
    in this chapter.

- en: In the example that we briefly described at the end of the previous section
    regarding data grounded against HR personnel data records and managing views,
    this is an obvious place where additional security precautions are needed, and
    also additional scrutiny or audits/reviews are mandatory.

- en: You may be wondering, “How?” Any LLM that has been grounded against your data
    should have safeguards in place against access to data that might be sensitive
    or confidential in nature, such as personnel records. As with a standard database,
    you will restrict access to such records. The same goes for generative AI; authentication
    and login are control mechanisms, so auditing to see who has had or can currently
    access this is important to ensure only the appropriate individuals or services
    have permission. Why not use a generative AI model to help here? After all, generative
    AI, as you know, can handle large amounts of data and help analyze transactional
    data, such as access, on many varieties of data services. Moreover, rather than
    a manual or occasional timeframe to start an audit process, perhaps the LLM can
    now run it on a regular basis or even run in real time, all the time! You can
    imagine how powerful such LLMs can be in helping an organization safeguard against
    security threats.

    and reporting. We covered Azure Monitoring in the previous chapter, which also
    has the ability to audit at the cloud platform level. That is, Azure can understand
    activity against an Azure OpenAI account, such as someone who creates a new AOAI
    account/service. Other tools such as Application Insights coupled with the Microsoft
    Fabric Reporting/Power BI, provide deeper application-layer insights and allow
    for the auditing of your generative AI applications.

    or need to be projected, ensuring data integrity persists and is aligned with
    the organization’s overall goals. While audits can capture details, breaches,
    or security gaps, if there is no actual review or action, then the audits can
    only go so far. This is where the other half of the equation of auditing comes
    into play: the actual reporting of the audit results.'

- en: Reporting is a fairly simple concept, and it means exactly what the name implies,
    so we will not delve into it too much here. The main point of this section is
    to emphasize that all the threats and security risks that might appear need to
    be neutralized, and all the security, access, and controls need to be buttoned
    up well; however, a regular (all the time?) audit will produce results or reports.
    These reports should be analyzed by both automated methods, likely, once again,
    to be generative AI and also have a human in the loop. The reports do not have
    to be fancy; however, when coupled with monitoring solutions, reporting can tell
    quite a powerful story in terms of giving your organization a more complete view
    of the security footprint.

    are required to help ensure that generative AI is developed, deployed, and managed
    responsibly and securely. Our hopes are to keep generative AI secure and trusted
    so that, in turn, generative AI will help improve every facet of our lives.
