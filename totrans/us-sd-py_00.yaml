- en: When Stable Diffusion was released on August 22, 2022, this Diffusion-based
    image generation model quickly caught the attention of the whole world. Both its
    model and source code are completely open source and hosted on GitHub. With millions
    of community participants and users, numerous new and mixed models have been released.
    Tools such as Stable Diffusion WebUI and InvokeAI have been created.

- en: While the Stable Diffusion WebUI tool can generate fantastic images driven by
    the diffusion model, its usability is limited. The open source Diffusers package
    from Hugging Face allows users to have full control over Stable Diffusion using
    Python. However, it lacks many key features, such as loading custom LoRA models
    and Textual Inversion, utilizing community-shared models/checkpoints, scheduling
    and weighted prompts, unlimited prompt tokens, fixing the resolution of the images,
    and upscaling. This book will assist you in overcoming the limitations of Diffusers
    and implementing the advanced features to create a fully customized and industrial-level
    Stable Diffusion application.

- en: By the end of this book, you will be able to not only use Python to generate
    and edit images but also leverage the solutions provided in the book to build
    Stable Diffusion applications for your business and users.
