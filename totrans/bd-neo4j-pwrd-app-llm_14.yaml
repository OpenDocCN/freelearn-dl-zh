    an inference model with consistent traffic. For instance, **Azure Reserved VM**
    instances provide predictable cost savings for steady-state usage. Consider a

    usage patterns. For example, **Amazon S3** and **Google Cloud Storage** offer
    tiered pricing to optimize costs based on access frequency. In the case of a video
