- en: We are living in an era of rapid technological transformation, where **artificial
    intelligence** (**AI**) is no longer just a tool but an active collaborator in
    our daily lives. Among the many advancements in AI, generative AI has emerged
    as a disruptive force, reshaping how we interact with technology, create content,
    and drive innovation. From generating human-like text and producing stunning visuals
    to composing music and even writing code, generative AI has unlocked possibilities
    that once belonged only to science fiction.
