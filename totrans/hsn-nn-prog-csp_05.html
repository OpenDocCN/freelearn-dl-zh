<p><a href="109d17e5-b0b3-4e74-9a0e-ffd43f7321e5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em><span>Function Optimizations: How and Why</span></em><span>, introduces you to function optimization, which is an integral part of every neural network.</span></p>
<p><a href="49705d0a-99be-485c-bb17-18b89709f74d.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <span><em>Finding Optimal Parameters</em></span><span>, will show you how to easily find the most optimal parameters for your neural network functions using Numeric and Heuristic Optimization techniques.</span></p>
<p><a href="cc2ded91-99a1-4919-ac6c-50302514bdec.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Object Detection with TensorFlowSharp</em>,<span> will expose the reader to the open source package TensorFlowSharp.</span></p>
<p><a href="bd1eefc7-c8d0-477a-a20d-fdd121f03fff.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Time Series Prediction and LSTM Using CNTK</em>, will see you<span> using the</span> Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, formerly known as CNTK, as well as long short-term memory (LSTM), to accomplish time series prediction.</p>
<p><a href="28d18e5b-d3fa-47dc-a249-909eaa4e6dc7.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>GRUs Compared to LSTMs, RNNs, and Feedforward Networks</em>, deals with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), including how they compare to other types of neural network.</p>
<p><a href="995a1c79-922f-4ea7-a631-e655916cbb37.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, <em>Activation Function Timings</em>, <span>shows different activation functions and their respective plots.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>:<span> </span><span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles.<span> </span><span>Here is an example:</span><span> </span>"Mount the downloaded<span> </span><kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd><span> </span>disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>m_va.Copy(vtmp, m_bestVectors[i])<br/>m_va.Sub(vtmp, particlePosition);<br/>m_va.MulRand(vtmp, m_c1);<br/>m_va.Add(m_velocities[i], vtmp);</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>BasicNetwork<strong>network</strong> = EncogUtility.SimpleFeedForward(2, 2, 0, 1, false);<br/>///Create a scoring/fitness object<br/>ICalculateScore score = new TrainingSetScore(trainingSet);</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
