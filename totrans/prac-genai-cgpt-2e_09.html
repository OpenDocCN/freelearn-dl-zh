<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-95">Research Reinvented with ChatGPT</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter is for researchers who wish to leverage ChatGPT. The chapter will go through a few main use cases that ChatGPT can address so that you will learn, from concrete examples, how ChatGPT can be used in research.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with using ChatGPT as a research assistant in many ways, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Researchers’ need for ChatGPT</li>
<li class="bulletList">Brainstorming literature for your study</li>
<li class="bulletList">Providing support for the design and framework of your experiment</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generating and formatting the bibliography to incorporate in your research study</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generating a presentation of the study</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">This chapter will also provide examples and enable you to try the prompts on your own.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-96">Researchers’ need for ChatGPT</h1>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can be an incredibly valuable resource for researchers across a wide range of fields. As a <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>sophisticated language model trained on vast amounts of data, ChatGPT can quickly and accurately process large amounts of information and generate insights that might be difficult or time-consuming to uncover through traditional research methods.</p>
<p class="normal">Additionally, ChatGPT can provide researchers with a unique perspective on their field, by analyzing patterns and trends that might not be immediately apparent to human researchers. For example, imagine a researcher studying climate change and wanting to understand the public perception of this issue. They might ask ChatGPT to analyze social media data related to climate change and identify the most common themes and sentiments expressed by people online. ChatGPT could then provide the researcher with a comprehensive <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>report detailing the most common words, phrases, and emotions associated with this topic, as well as any emerging trends or patterns that might be useful to know.</p>
<p class="normal">By working with ChatGPT, researchers can gain access to cutting-edge technology and insights and stay at the forefront of their field.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s now dive deeper into four use cases where ChatGPT can boost research productivity.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Most of the examples proposed in this chapter are based on up-to-date information; in fact, you will see ChatGPT leveraging the web search plugin very often.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-97">Brainstorming literature for your study</h1>
<p class="normal">A literature review is a critical and systematic process of examining existing published research on <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>a specific topic or question. It involves searching, reviewing, and synthesizing relevant published studies and other sources, such as books, conference proceedings, and peer-reviewed literature. The goal of a literature review is to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities for further research in a particular field.</p>
<p class="normal">The literature review process typically involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="screenText">Defining the research question</strong>: The first step in conducting a literature review is to define the research question of the topic of interest. So, let’s say we are carrying out research on the effects of social media on mental health. Now, we are interested in brainstorming some possible research questions to focus our research on, and we can leverage ChatGPT to do so:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.1: Examples of research questions based on a given topic</p>
<p class="normal">Those are <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>all interesting questions that could be further investigated. Since I’m particularly interested in the first one – “How does the frequency and type of social media usage impact levels of anxiety and depression among teenagers?” – I will keep that one as a reference for the next steps of our analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2"><strong class="screenText">Searching for literature</strong>: Now that we have our research question, the next step is to search for relevant literature using a variety of databases, search engines, and other sources. Researchers can use specific keywords and search terms to help identify relevant studies.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.2: Literature search with the support of ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Starting from <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>the suggestions of ChatGPT, we can start diving deeper into those references.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3"><strong class="screenText">Screening the literature</strong>: Once relevant literature has been identified, the next step is to screen the studies to determine whether they meet the inclusion criteria for the review. This typically involves reviewing the abstract and, if necessary, the full text of the study. To Let’s say, for example, that we want to go deeper into the <em class="italic">Social Media and Teen Anxiety: Insights from Harvard Graduate School of Education</em> research paper. Let’s ask ChatGPT to screen it for us:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.3: Literature screening of a specific paper</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT was able to provide me with an overview of the paper. Considering its research question and main topics of discussion, I think it will be pretty useful for my own study.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4"><strong class="screenText">Extracting data</strong>: After the relevant studies have been identified, researchers will need to <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>extract data from each study, such as the study design, sample size, data collection methods, and key findings. For example, let’s say that we want to gather the following information from the paper <em class="italic">Digital Self-Harm: Prevalence, Motivations, and Outcomes by Hinduja and Patchin </em>(2018):<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The data sources collected in the paper and the subject of the study</li>
<li class="bulletList">The data collection method adopted by researchers</li>
<li class="bulletList">The data sample size</li>
<li class="bulletList">The main limitations and drawbacks of the analysis</li>
<li class="bulletList">The experiment design adopted by researchers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Here is how it goes:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.4: Extracting relevant data and frameworks from a given paper</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5"><strong class="screenText">Synthesizing the literature</strong>: The final step in the literature review process is to synthesize <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>the findings of the studies and draw conclusions about the current state of knowledge in the field. This may involve identifying common themes, highlighting gaps or inconsistencies in the literature, and identifying opportunities for future research.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Let’s imagine that, besides the papers proposed by ChatGPT, we have collected other titles and papers we want to synthesize. More specifically, we want to understand whether they drive the same conclusions, what the common trends are, and which method might be more reliable than others. For this scenario, we will consider three research papers:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The Effects of Social Media on Mental Health: A Proposed Study</em>, by Grant Sean Bossard (<a href="https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&amp;context=senproj_f2020">https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&amp;context=senproj_f2020</a>)</li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health</em>, by Vardanush Palyan (<a href="https://www.spotlightonresearch.com/mental-health-research/the-impact-of-social-media-on-mental-health">https://www.spotlightonresearch.com/mental-health-research/the-impact-of- social-media-on-mental-health</a>)</li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health: A mixed-methods research of service providers’ awareness</em>, by Sarah Nichole Koehler and Bobbie Rose Parrell (<a href="https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2131&amp;context=etd">https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2131&amp;context=etd</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Here is <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>how the results appear:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.5: Literature analysis and benchmarking of three research papers</p>
<p class="normal">Also, in this case, ChatGPT was able to produce a relevant summary and analysis of the three papers provided, including benchmarking among the methods and reliability considerations.</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, ChatGPT was able to carry out many activities in the field of literature review, from research <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>question brainstorming to literature synthesis. As always, a <strong class="keyWord">subject-matter expert </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">SME</strong>) is needed in the loop to review the results; however, with ChatGPT’s assistance, many activities can be done more efficiently.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">As a common best practice, it is recommended to always add a disclaimer for any contribution of an AI tool whenever publishing something that was developed – even partially – by such a tool (which might be ChatGPT or a similar tool). This ensures transparency with the end users of your product (research paper, article, book, and so on) and sets them in the position of being more receptive to potential biases or hallucinations.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Another activity <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>that can be supported by ChatGPT is the design of the experiment the researcher wants to carry out. We are going to look at that in the following section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-98">Bonus prompts</h2>
<p class="normal">When we interact with ChatGPT to brainstorm about possible research questions, a good prompting <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>technique might be <strong class="keyWord">question refinement prompting</strong>. With this approach, the LLM takes the user through a series of iterations to finalize a question. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Iterative question refinement for research brainstorming</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Objective: Collaboratively refine impactful research questions through iterative feedback and dialogue with ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Step 1: Initial Brainstorm</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Prompt: “I am conducting a research study in the field of [insert field/topic]. The specific area I am interested in is [insert specific area or theme]. Please generate 5 preliminary research questions that explore key challenges, trends, or knowledge gaps in this field.”</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Step 2: Refinement</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Follow-Up Prompt: “Thank you for the questions! Here’s my feedback:</p>
<p class="normal">Question [insert number] needs to focus more on [insert focus area].</p>
<p class="normal">Question [insert number] feels too broad. Can you narrow it down to focus on [specific aspect]?</p>
<p class="normal">Question [insert number] is compelling but could benefit from addressing [specific audience, outcome, or data].</p>
<p class="normal">Based on this feedback, refine the questions to better align with my goals.”</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Step 3: Final Polishing</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Follow-Up Prompt: “I appreciate the refinements. Now:</p>
<p class="normal">Combine elements of Questions [insert numbers] into one cohesive question.</p>
<p class="normal">Ensure the language is clear and concise.</p>
<p class="normal">Suggest any final adjustments to make these questions more impactful.”</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">With this approach, we are “encouraging” the model to work step by step and progressively refine its output.</p>
<p class="normal">Another interesting technique of prompting, which is very handy for structuring the output of your query, is that of leveraging a so-called <em class="italic">prompt pattern</em>. Developed by Dr. Jules White and his colleagues, prompt patterns are reusable solutions designed to address common challenges <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>encountered when interacting with LLMs. They function similarly to software design patterns by providing structured methods to achieve specific outcomes in LLM interactions. This approach is detailed in their paper, <em class="italic">A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT</em> (you can find the original catalog at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382</a>).</p>
<p class="normal">For example, when extracting relevant information from documents (as covered in this section), we might want to make sure to gather specific elements like the research question or the study design:</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Prompt</strong></p>
<p class="normal">I need a structured template for extracting key data from research papers efficiently. The template should include the following sections:</p>
<p class="normal">Paper Details (Title, Authors, Year, Journal, DOI/URL).</p>
<p class="normal">Research Question(s) or Objective(s).</p>
<p class="normal">Study Design (e.g., experimental, observational, meta-analysis).</p>
<p class="normal">Methods (sample size, data collection techniques, tools used).</p>
<p class="normal">Key Findings or Results.</p>
<p class="normal">Limitations and Recommendations.</p>
<p class="normal">Please format this template as a table or checklist that researchers can easily fill out when reviewing papers.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">With such a template pattern, you make sure to keep consistency across the data gathered from multiple sources.</p>
<p class="normal">Similarly, the same technique can be used when comparing different research papers or, more generally, documents. In this section, we covered an example where we leveraged the web search tool to retrieve information about papers and compare them. However, if you want to follow a more structured and controlled approach, you can upload the two or more papers you want to benchmark and run a prompt like the following one (taken from the catalog of Dr. White. You can find the original catalog at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382</a>):</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Prompt</strong></p>
<p class="normal">I have reviewed several research papers on the topic of [insert topic, e.g., “the effects of social media on mental health”] and they are attached. I need to synthesize their findings into a cohesive summary that highlights:</p>
<p class="normal">Common themes or trends across the papers.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Key differences or conflicting results.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Gaps or limitations identified in the literature.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Implications for future research or practical applications.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Please structure the synthesis as follows:</p>
<p class="normal">Introduction: Brief overview of the topic and the scope of the papers reviewed.</p>
<p class="normal">Common Themes: Identify and summarize shared findings or recurring patterns.</p>
<p class="normal">Contrasting Results: Highlight any major differences or contradictions among the papers.</p>
<p class="normal">Gaps and Opportunities: Discuss areas where further research is needed.</p>
<p class="normal">Conclusion: Provide an overall summary and potential directions for future studies.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">By applying <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>these prompt patterns, users can systematically design prompts that guide LLMs to produce more reliable and contextually appropriate outputs, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of human-AI collaboration.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-99">Providing support for the design and framework of your experiment</h1>
<p class="normal">Experiment design <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>is the process of planning and executing a scientific experiment or study to answer a research question. It involves making decisions about the study’s design, the variables to be measured, the sample size, and the procedures for collecting and analyzing data.</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can help in experiment design for research by suggesting to you the study framework, such as a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental design, or a correlational study, and supporting you alongside the implementation of that design.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s consider the following scenario. We want to investigate the effects of a new educational <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>program on student learning outcomes in mathematics. This new program entails <strong class="keyWord">project-based learning</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PBL</strong>), meaning that students are asked <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>to work collaboratively on real-world projects, using math concepts and skills to solve problems and create solutions.</p>
<p class="normal">For this purpose, we defined our research question as follows:</p>
<p class="normal">How does the new PBL program compare to traditional teaching methods in improving student performance?</p>
<p class="normal">Here’s how ChatGPT can help:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Determining study design</strong>: ChatGPT can assist in determining the appropriate study design for the research question, such as a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental design, or correlational study.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.6: ChatGPT suggesting the appropriate study design for your experiment</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>suggested proceeding with a <strong class="keyWord">randomized controlled trial</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RCT</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>provided a clear explanation of the reason behind it.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Definition</strong></p>
<p class="normal">An RCT is a scientific study design used to measure the effectiveness of an intervention by randomly assigning participants to two or more groups:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Experimental group</strong>: Receives the intervention or treatment being tested</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Control group</strong>: Receives a placebo, standard treatment, or no intervention</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By randomly assigning participants, RCTs minimize bias and ensure that differences in outcomes are due to the intervention itself rather than external factors. They are considered the gold standard in clinical and social science research for establishing causality between an intervention and its effects.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">It seems reasonable to me to proceed with this approach: the next steps will be to identify outcome measures and variables to consider in our experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Identifying outcome measures</strong>: ChatGPT can help you identify some potential outcome <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>measures to determine the results of your test. Let’s ask for some suggestions for our study:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.7: Learning outcomes for the given research study</p>
<p class="normal">It is reasonable for me to pick test scores as the outcome measure.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Identifying variables</strong>: ChatGPT can help the researcher to identify the independent <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>and dependent variables in the study:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.8: ChatGPT generating variables for the given study</p>
<p class="normal">Note that ChatGPT was also able to generate the type of variables, called control variables, that are specific to the study design we are considering (RCT).</p>
<p class="normal">Control variables, also known as covariates, are variables that are held constant or are controlled in a research study in order to isolate the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. These variables are not the primary focus <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>of the study but are included to minimize the effect of confounding variables on the results. By controlling these variables, researchers can reduce the risk of obtaining false positive or false negative results and increase the internal reliability, validity, transparency, and reproducibility of their study.</p>
<p class="normal">With the preceding variables, we are ready to set up our experiment. Now we need to select participants, and ChatGPT can assist us with that.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Sampling strategy</strong>: ChatGPT can suggest potential sampling strategies for the study:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.9: RCT sampling strategy suggestion from ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Note that it is always a good practice to ask AI tools to generate more options with explanations behind them so that you can make a reasoned decision. For this example, let’s go ahead with what ChatGPT suggested to us, which also includes suggestions about the population of interest and sample size.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Data analysis</strong>: ChatGPT can assist the researcher in determining the appropriate statistical <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>tests to analyze the data collected from the study, such as ANCOVA, t-tests, or regression analysis.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.10: ChatGPT suggests a statistical test for a given study</p>
<p class="normal">Everything suggested by ChatGPT is coherent and finds confirmation in papers about how to conduct a statistical test. It was also able to identify that we are probably talking about a continuous variable (that is, scores) so that we know that all the information ahead is based on this assumption. In the case that we want to have discrete scores, we might adjust the prompt by <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>adding this information, and ChatGPT will then suggest a different approach.</p>
<p class="normal">The fact that ChatGPT specifies assumptions and explains its reasoning is key to making safe decisions based on its input.</p>
<p class="normal">In conclusion, ChatGPT <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>can be a valuable tool for researchers when designing experiments. By utilizing its <strong class="keyWord">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">NLP</strong>) capabilities and vast knowledge base, ChatGPT can help researchers select appropriate study designs, determine sampling techniques, identify variables and learning outcomes, and even suggest statistical tests to analyze the data.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we are going to move forward in exploring how ChatGPT can support researchers, focusing on bibliography generation.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-100">Bonus prompts</h2>
<p class="normal">Dr. White’s prompt <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>catalog can be very handy also when you are designing your research experiment. For example, let’s consider the <strong class="screenText">recipe pattern</strong> (source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11382">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11382</a>):</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Prompt</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Instructions for AI: Please provide a step-by-step plan to design a robust experiment for this research goal. Ensure the response includes the following components:</p>
<p class="normal">Participants: How to select and assign participants.</p>
<p class="normal">Pre-Test: Steps to measure the baseline performance of participants.</p>
<p class="normal">Intervention: Outline the PBL program implementation and control group treatment.</p>
<p class="normal">Post-Test: Methods for evaluating the outcomes after the intervention.</p>
<p class="normal">Data Analysis: Specify statistical methods for comparing the results and ensuring validity.</p>
<p class="normal">Output Format:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Present each step clearly and concisely.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Provide reasoning for each step to justify its inclusion.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Conclude with why this study design is suitable for answering the research question.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="normal">This pattern is indeed particularly beneficial when users have a general understanding of their goal and some of the necessary steps but require assistance in organizing these steps into a coherent and complete sequence.</p>
<p class="normal">Another revised prompt that you might want to try for your experiment design is the following:</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Prompt</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Context: You are designing a <strong class="keyWord">randomized controlled trial</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RCT</strong>) to compare the effectiveness of a <strong class="keyWord">project-based learning</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PBL</strong>) program with traditional teaching methods in improving student performance. The study requires defining specific outcome metrics to evaluate the program’s success.</p>
</div>
<div><p class="normal">Directions: Generate a detailed list of potential outcome metrics that are specific, measurable, and relevant to assessing student performance. Include metrics across academic, cognitive, and behavioral domains.</p>
<p class="normal">Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Avoid overly general metrics (e.g., “student improvement”).</li>
<li class="bulletList">Ensure metrics are realistic and feasible to measure within the context of an RCT.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Focus on metrics that can provide a comprehensive evaluation of both teaching methods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Output: Provide a structured list of at least 5-7 outcome metrics, each with a brief explanation of how it contributes to evaluating the effectiveness of the PBL program.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">In this case, we used clear delimiters and structured output patterns to make sure ChatGPT follows a scientific approach. Plus, we also incorporated limitations, which is an effective, explicit way to reduce hallucination.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-101">Generating and formatting a bibliography</h1>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can support researchers in bibliography generation by providing automated citation and <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>reference tools. These tools can generate accurate <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>citations and references for a wide range of sources, including books, articles, websites, and more. ChatGPT knows various citation styles, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, and Harvard, allowing researchers to select the appropriate style for their work. Additionally, ChatGPT can also suggest relevant sources based on the researcher’s input, helping to streamline the research process and ensure that all necessary sources are included in the bibliography. By utilizing these tools, researchers can save time and ensure that their bibliography is accurate and comprehensive.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s consider the following example. Let’s say we finalized a research paper titled <em class="italic">The Impact of Technology on Workplace Productivity: An Empirical Study</em>. During the research and writing process, we collected the following references to papers, websites, videos, and other sources <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>that we need to include in the bibliography (in order, three <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>research papers, one YouTube video, and one website):</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The second machine age: Work, progress, and prosperity in a time of brilliant technologies</em>. Brynjolfsson, 2014. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-07087-000 ">https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-07087-000</a></li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The Impact of Technostress on Role Stress and Productivity</em>. Tarafdar, 2014. Pages 301-328. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222240109">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222240109</a></li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">The big debate about the future of work, explained</em>. Vox. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmyygCMMGA ">https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=TUmyygCMMGA</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Obviously, we cannot have the preceding list in our research paper; we need proper formatting for it. To do so, we can provide ChatGPT with the raw list of references and ask it to regenerate it with the specific format – for example, the Chicago style, commonly used as a reference format style in education, psychology, and social sciences.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see how ChatGPT works with that:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.11: A list of references generated in Chicago format by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Note that I specified <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>not to add details in case ChatGPT doesn’t know <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>them. Indeed, I noticed that sometimes ChatGPT was adding the month and day of publication, making some mistakes.</p>
<p class="normal">Another interesting assistance ChatGPT can provide is that of suggesting potential reference papers we might want to quote. We’ve already seen in this chapter how ChatGPT is able to brainstorm relevant literature before the writing process; however, once the paper is done, we might have forgotten to quote relevant literature, or even not be aware of having quoted someone else’s work.</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can be a great assistant in brainstorming possible references we might have missed. Let’s consider <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>once more our paper, which focused on the research question “How does the frequency and type of social media usage impact levels of anxiety and <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>depression among teenagers.” Let’s say that we set the following title, which has the following abstract:</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Title:</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The Influence of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Mental Health: Examining the Relationship Between Frequency, Content Type, and Levels of Anxiety and Depression</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Abstract:</strong> </p>
<p class="normal">Social media has become an integral part of adolescent life, yet its impact on mental health remains a subject of debate. This study investigates the relationship between the frequency and type of social media usage and levels of anxiety and depression among teenagers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze survey data from adolescents aged 13–18 to assess their social media habits, content preferences, and self-reported mental health symptoms. The findings reveal that excessive social media use, particularly engagement with negatively valenced or highly curated content, correlates with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Conversely, positive interactions and supportive online communities may mitigate these effects. The study highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of social media’s psychological impact and suggests interventions to promote healthier digital habits among teenagers.</p>

<p class="normal">Let’s ask ChatGPT to list all the possible references that might be related to this kind of research:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.12: List of references related to the provided abstract</p>
<p class="normal">You can repeat this <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>process with other sections of your paper also, to make <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>sure you are not missing any relevant references to include in your bibliography.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you have your study ready, you will probably need to present it with an elevator pitch. In the next section, we will see how ChatGPT can also support this task.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-102">Generating a presentation of the study</h1>
<p class="normal">The last mile of a research study is often that of being presented to various audiences. This might <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>involve preparing a slide deck, pitch, or webinar where the researcher needs to address different kinds of audiences.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s say, for example, that our study now titled <em class="italic">The Influence of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Mental Health: Examining the Relationship Between Frequency, Content Type, and Levels of Anxiety and Depression</em><strong class="keyWord"> </strong>is meant for a master’s degree thesis discussion. In that case, we can ask ChatGPT to produce a pitch structure that is meant to last 15 minutes and adheres to the scientific method. Let’s see what kind of results are produced (as context, I’m referring to the abstract given earlier):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.13: Thesis discussion generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">That was <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>impressive! Back in my university days, it would have been useful to have such a tool to assist me in my discussion design.</p>
<p class="normal">Starting from this structure, we can also ask ChatGPT to generate a slide deck as a visual for our thesis discussion.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>proceed with this request:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.14: Slide deck structure based on a discussion pitch</p>
<p class="normal">Then, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>also ask ChatGPT to generate the deck as an asset to be downloaded:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.15: Generating a deck as a downloadable asset</p>
<p class="normal">What happens in the backend is that ChatGPT generates Python code to create your deck:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.16: ChatGPT running Python code in the backend</p>
<p class="normal">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>click on the provided link, you will be able to download the generated deck:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.17: The generated deck</p>
<p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>can see, the outline has been preserved according to our request.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, let’s imagine that our thesis discussion was outstanding to the point that it might be selected to receive research funds in order to keep investigating the topic. Now we need an elevator pitch to convince the funding committee. Let’s ask for some support from ChatGPT:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_07_18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.18: Elevator pitch for the given thesis</p>
<p class="normal">We can always <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>adjust the results and make them more aligned with what we are looking for; however, having structures and frameworks already available can save a lot of time and allow us to focus more on the technical content we want to bring.</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, ChatGPT is able to support an end-to-end journey in research, from literature collection and review to the generation of the final pitch of the study, and we’ve demonstrated how it can be a great AI assistant for researchers.</p>
<p class="normal">Furthermore, note that in the field of research, some tools that are different from ChatGPT yet still powered by GPT models have been developed recently. An example is Humata.ai, an AI-powered tool that allows you to upload your documents and perform several actions on them, including summarization, instant Q&amp;A, and new paper generation based on uploaded files.</p>
<p class="normal">This suggests <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>how GPT-powered tools (including ChatGPT) are paving the way toward several innovations within the research domain.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-103">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we explored the use of ChatGPT as a valuable tool for researchers. Through literature review, experiment design, bibliography generation and formatting, and presentation generation, ChatGPT can assist the researcher in speeding up those activities with low or zero added value, so that they can focus on relevant activities.</p>
<p class="normal">Note that we focused only on a small set of activities where ChatGPT can support researchers. There are many other activities within the domain of research that could benefit from the support of ChatGPT, among which we can mention data collection, study participant recruitment, research networking, public engagement, and many others.</p>
<p class="normal">Researchers who incorporate this tool into their work can benefit from its versatility and time-saving features, ultimately leading to more impactful research outcomes.</p>
<p class="normal">However, it is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is only a tool and should be used in conjunction with expert knowledge and judgment. As with any research project, careful consideration of the research question and study design is necessary to ensure the validity and reliability of the results.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will start seeing some examples of multimodality, by incorporating the ChatGPT visual capabilities for image understanding and generation.</p>
