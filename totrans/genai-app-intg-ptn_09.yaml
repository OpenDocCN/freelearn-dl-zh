    to “learn to learn” from a small amount of information. This is particularly useful

    model to specific tasks or domains. Unlike few-shot learning, which occurs at
    inference time, fine-tuning involves additional training on a targeted dataset.
    This process allows the model to adjust its parameters and specialize in a particular
    area without losing its broad language understanding. Fine-tuning can significantly
    improve performance on domain-specific tasks, such as medical text analysis or
    legal document processing, by teaching the model relevant vocabulary, context,
    and nuances. This approach is particularly valuable when you have a moderate amount
    of task-specific data and want to create a more specialized model that outperforms
    generic prompting techniques. Recent advancements have introduced efficient fine-tuning
    methods like **Low-Rank Adaptation** (**LoRA**), which reduces the number of trainable
    parameters by adding small, trainable rank decomposition matrices to each layer.
    Other techniques such as prefix tuning (which prepends trainable parameters to
    the input), prompt tuning (which optimizes a small set of continuous task-specific
    vectors), and AdapterHub (which introduces small, trainable modules between existing
    layers) offer alternative ways to adapt models with minimal computational overhead.
    These methods enable more efficient and flexible adaptation of LLMs, making fine-tuning
    more accessible and resource friendly. Fine-tuning, especially with these efficient
    techniques, strikes a balance between the resource-intensive process of training
    a model from scratch and the limitations of using a general-purpose model for
    specialized applications.'

    and substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs or TPUs.
    Unlike fine-tuning, which adapts a pre-trained model for specific tasks, full
    retraining aims to create a model with broad language understanding and generation
    capabilities. This method allows for the incorporation of new knowledge, languages,
