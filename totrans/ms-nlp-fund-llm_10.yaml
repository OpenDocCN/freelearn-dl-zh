    language; it could be either Python, R, C++ or any other general-purpose language.
    It comes with its inherited “knowledge,” which is the built-in libraries and functions.
    If you build code to perform basic math or form a sorted list, you’ll find that
    the current state of the programming language suits you, as it has built-in code
    libraries with all the functions you require. However, how about when you are
    looking to perform some action that is extremely different from the common set
    of libraries and their functions? For instance, translate a foreign language to
    English, calculate a Fourier transform, or perform image classification. One could,
    hypothetically, seek to develop a whole new dedicated programming language for
    which the intrinsic set of built-in libraries includes all the functionality that
    they require. Conversely, one might simply build a dedicated library and import
    it into their programming language’s environment. In this way, your code simply
    retrieves the necessary functions. Clearly, that is the way general-purpose programming
    languages work, which is the easiest and most scalable solution of the two. That
    is what RAGs seek to achieve in the context of LLMs. The LLM is analogous to the
    programming language, and the retrieval of the information from an external data
    source is analogous to importing a dedicated library.

    technology, this presents various challenges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One such challenge is the choice of the structure design of retrieved data,
    which is significant to the functionality of the RAG. It is common practice to
    process the raw data ahead of time, in bulk, so that when the LLM is used, the
    data are already in a format that lends itself to the retrieval process. As such,
    this offline process has a complexity of O(1) when measured as a function of the
    number of retrievals or prompts. Vector databases are emerging as the go-to design
    for this purpose. They are numerical databases that aim to capture a minimal representation
    of the data in a format that is similar and sometimes identical to the format
    that the LLM employs when it processes a prompt. This format is the embeddings
    that we have covered throughout the book. It should be added that embeddings are
    a form of a lossy compression mechanism. While the embedding space is optimized
    for a predefined purpose, it isn’t perfect in two senses. First, it optimizes
    a particular loss function that may suit one purpose more than another, and second,
    it does so while trading off other aspects, such as storage and run time. We are
    seeing a trend within the embedding space where the dimensionality—the size of
    the embedding vector—is growing higher. A higher dimensionality accommodates a
    broader context per vector, thus opening the door for better retrieval mechanisms
    that, in turn, accommodate domains that require deep and complex insights, such
    as the legal space or journalism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another downside is the fact that in order to accommodate for the added information
    that the external data source is providing, the prompt that is sent to the LLM
    needs to grow in size. Now, the prompt isn’t expected to host the entire database’s
    text. A preliminary mechanism is first applied to narrow down the text that might
    be relevant, as we have seen in our code example in the healthcare space. Still,
    a cutoff must be applied to the amount of data that is sent within the prompt,
    thus trading off the amount of context the LLM has to refer to.

    with the rise of digitalization, the explosion of data, and advancements in open
    source ML, businesses began to recognize its potential. The affordability of computing
    power and accessibility to vast datasets made the implementation of LLMs feasible
    for enterprises, allowing for more sophisticated NLP applications. We observed
    that this transition of NLP into the business world took place from 2018–2019\.
    First, the combination of NLP and traditional ML models for the purpose of limited
    tasks, such as text classification, began to infiltrate business operations and
    analytics. In 2019, Hugging Face released a free version of Google’s BERT, its
    groundbreaking LM, which we discussed in previous chapters (see more detail on
    the model page: [https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)).
    BERT employed transfer learning in a way that allowed for great classification
    power with a relatively minimal amount of labeled data, and it quickly became
    the go-to model for many text-driven business models.'

    the healthcare space that interacts with patient treatment, whether it is a clinic,
    a hospital, or even in an insurer, has a data stream that involves free text.
    It could be a transcription of medical notes, patient query responses, drug interactions,
    and other sources of information. The vast majority of those are digitized and
    are, thus, machine-readable, making this a setup for downstream processing. Those
    processes could be around identifying diagnoses from radiology reports, classifying
    patient details for treatment, clinical trials based on physician notes, alerting
    potential risk based on patient reporting, and many other use cases.

    and non-separable part of our lives. We analogize it to the narrow and limited
    role that the digital calendar takes in our lives. By allowing us to plan and
    schedule events efficiently, keeping a calendar ensures we meet commitments and
    maintain a balance between personal and professional engagements. Furthermore,
    automated reminders and synchronization across devices alleviate the pressure
    to remember every appointment, letting us focus on more pressing matters with
    peace of mind. A personal assistant, whether AI-driven or human, takes things
    to the next level. It syncs with other individuals, prioritizes, advises, gathers
    information, and performs other common day-to-day tasks. Until recently, only
    human assistants could fulfill this function with high confidence. We will soon
    see this done by automated models with little cost and oversight. If you are wearing
    prescription glasses, you know exactly what our relationship with our personal
    AI assistant will be like and, moreover, what it would be like if you lost access
    to it.
