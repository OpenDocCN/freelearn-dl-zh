			<p>In our previous chapter, we laid the foundation for how generative AI-powered assistants help developers improve their productivity, and we also looked at some of the assistants available in the market. In this chapter, we will focus on <strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer</strong> – a <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>developer tool that helps us understand and build applications using generative AI. It supports developers across the software development lifecycle. With Amazon Q Developer, employees receive timely, pertinent information and guidance, facilitating streamlined tasks, faster decision-making, and effective problem-solving, and fostering creativity and innovation in <span class="No-Break">the workplace.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s get started with an important note on the <span class="No-Break">service nomenclature.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Amazon Q nomenclature</h1>
			<p>Before we go any further, we want to clarify the nomenclature to prevent any misunderstandings for the remainder of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon Q</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> flagship term used to refer to the generative AI-powered assistant from AWS. Under this term, there are multiple products and/or features of existing AWS services that specifically assist with certain types of technology domains and the personas that typically work in those domains. Let’s quickly look <span class="No-Break">at those:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Q Business</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>is a generative AI-powered assistant capable of answering questions, providing summaries, generating content, and securely completing tasks based on data from your enterprise systems.

It seamlessly integrates with your existing <strong class="bold">enterprise resource planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>) and<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> supply chain management systems. With Amazon Q in AWS Supply Chain, inventory managers, supply and demand planners, and other stakeholders can ask questions and receive intelligent <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>answers about their supply chain’s status, underlying causes, and recommended actions. They can also explore “what-if” scenarios to evaluate the trade-offs of various supply <span class="No-Break">chain decisions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>book focuses on this service. It assists developers and IT professionals with a wide range of tasks, including coding, testing, upgrading applications, diagnosing errors, performing security scans and fixes, and optimizing <span class="No-Break">AWS resources.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Legacy name and nomenclature used in this book</p>
			<p class="callout">The code assistant was previously called Amazon CodeWhisperer and has now been rebranded as part of Amazon Q Developer. You may see the legacy name CodeWhisperer in some places while using the tool with multiple AWS services, but it’s all part of Amazon Q <span class="No-Break">Developer now.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Also, throughout the book, for brevity, we will sometimes use the terms Amazon Q, Q Developer, or just Q to refer to <strong class="bold">Amazon </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Q Developer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Before we dive into how to set up Amazon Q Developer in different environments, let’s first explore some of <span class="No-Break">its basics.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Amazon Q Developer basics</h1>
			<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>understanding the challenges developers face, AWS created a generative AI-powered assistant – Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<p>Developers typically follow <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>the <strong class="bold">software development lifecycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>): plan, create, test, operate, and maintain. Each stage in this process is often repetitive and error-prone. As a result, the process takes significant time and effort, hampering developer productivity. The following figure shows the typical SDLC tasks on which developers spend time <span class="No-Break">and effort.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer010">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – The SDLC tasks that developers spend the most time on</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> assists developers across the SDLC. Let’s look at this at a high level before diving deep into each of these components throughout <span class="No-Break">the book:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan</strong>: Amazon Q assists during the planning phase by providing code explanations and helping with AWS best practices <span class="No-Break">and recommendations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create</strong>: Amazon Q enhances development productivity by offering in-line coding suggestions, generating new features using natural language, and allowing you to ask questions directly <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>within the <strong class="bold">integrated development </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">environment </strong></span><span class="No-Break">(</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IDE</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Test</strong>: Amazon Q aids developers in verifying the functionality and security of their code. It assists in unit testing and identifies and resolves security vulnerabilities earlier in the <span class="No-Break">development cycle.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operate</strong>: Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>is equipped to troubleshoot errors, analyze VPC reachability, and provide enhanced debugging and <span class="No-Break">optimization suggestions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintain</strong>: Amazon Q’s Code Transformation feature assists in maintaining and modernizing code by upgrading projects to newer <span class="No-Break">language versions.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let’s look at the features of Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Amazon Q Developer features</h1>
			<p>We have dedicated <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>chapters to dive deep into each of the features. This chapter will introduce the capabilities and help you complete the initial setup required for it to work with different tools. Let’s begin with the most important feature, <span class="No-Break">auto-code generation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Auto-code generation</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer’s <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>ability to generate substantial code accelerates application development, enabling developers to address previously unattended business-critical issues. This creates additional time for envisioning and crafting next-generation innovative experiences. Additionally, by conducting security scans <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>within the <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>), it identifies and rectifies potential vulnerabilities early in the application lifecycle, reducing costs, time, and risks associated <span class="No-Break">with development.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer seamlessly integrates into the developer’s IDE. By installing the Amazon Q IDE extension, developers can start coding immediately. As code is written, Amazon Q Developer autonomously assesses both the code and accompanying comments. Recognizing natural language comments (in English), Q provides multiple real-time code suggestions, even offering completion suggestions for comments as they <span class="No-Break">are written.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q goes <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>beyond individual code snippets, suggesting entire functions and logical code blocks, often spanning 10–15 lines, directly within the IDE’s code editor. The generated code mirrors the developer’s writing style and adheres to their naming conventions. Developers can swiftly accept the top suggestion (using the <em class="italic">tab</em> key), explore additional suggestions (using arrow keys), or seamlessly continue with their own code creation process. A link to the complete list of user actions for Amazon Q Developer in different IDEs is provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer supports many programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, shell scripting, SQL, and Scala. Additionally, Q Developer is accessible as an extension in many IDEs such as Visual Studio, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs, and is natively available in AWS Lambda, Amazon SageMaker Studio, Amazon EMR Studio, Amazon Redshift, Amazon CodeCatalyst, and AWS <span class="No-Break">Glue Studio.</span></p>
			<p>We have multiple chapters related to auto-code generation in <em class="italic">Parts 2, 3 and 4</em> of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Code customizations</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>enhances its suggestions by considering the nuances of internal codebases, which is crucial for organizations with extensive repositories, internal APIs, and unique coding practices. Developers often grapple with navigating large internal code repositories that lack comprehensive documentation. To address this, Amazon Q allows secure integration with an organization’s private repositories. With just a few clicks, developers can tailor Amazon Q to provide real-time recommendations aligned with internal libraries, APIs, packages, classes, <span class="No-Break">and methods.</span></p>
			<p>This customization supports multiple data sources, enabling organizations to verify that recommendations align with coding standards, security protocols, and performance best practices. Administrators have granular control, selecting repositories for customization securely and implementing strict access controls. They decide which customizations to activate and manage access for developers within the organization. Each customization operates independently, preserving the integrity of the foundational model and safeguarding intellectual property. This ensures that only authorized members with specific access can view, access, and utilize these <span class="No-Break">tailored recommendations.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Code transformations</h2>
			<p>Currently, Amazon Q lets<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> you upgrade code written in Java 8 and Java 11 to Java 17. To assist with this feature, the Amazon Q Developer Agent for Code Transformation is available to generate a transformation plan used to upgrade your code. After transforming your code, it provides a transformation summary and a file difference, allowing you to review the changes before <span class="No-Break">accepting them.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Code explanation, optimization, and update</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> can explain, optimize, refactor, fix, and update specific lines of code within your IDE. To update your <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>code, simply ask Amazon Q to modify a particular line or block of code. It will generate new code that incorporates<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> the requested changes, which you can then insert directly into the <span class="No-Break">original file.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Code feature development</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>Amazon Q Developer Agent assists with developing code features or making changes to projects within your IDE. Describe the feature you want to create, and Amazon Q will use the context of your current project to generate an implementation plan and the necessary code to bring the feature <span class="No-Break">to life.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Reference tracking</h2>
			<p>Trained<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> on extensive datasets comprising billions of lines from both Amazon and open source code, Amazon Q Developer recognizes instances where a code suggestion resembles specific open source training data. It can annotate such suggestions with repository and licensing details. Additionally, it keeps a record of accepted suggestions that share similarities with the training data, facilitating the provision of <span class="No-Break">proper attribution.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor174"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Security scanning</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>also helps conduct scans on both generated and developer-written code to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It also provides recommendations for addressing identified vulnerabilities. The scanning process extends to detecting elusive security issues and is compatible with Python, Java, and JavaScript in VS Code and <span class="No-Break">JetBrains IDEs.</span></p>
			<p>Security scans <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>cover various aspects, including compliance with <strong class="bold">Open Worldwide Application Security Project</strong> (<strong class="bold">OWASP</strong>) standards, enforcement of cryptographic library practices, adherence to AWS security standards, and other <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover this topic in depth in <a href="B21378_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor197"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Integration with AWS services</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>also accelerates development on AWS by integrating with many services, allowing for rapid application building using <span class="No-Break">AWS services.</span></p>
			<p>Data engineers can expedite the creation of data pipelines by leveraging Q’s integration with AWS Glue Studio Notebook and Amazon EMR Notebook. Creating SQL queries in Redshift becomes simple by articulating business outcomes using plain English sentences, as Q auto-generates SQL queries within the Redshift query editor. Data scientists and ML engineers can accelerate the ML development process by leveraging Q’s integration with Amazon <span class="No-Break">SageMaker Studio.</span></p>
			<p>AWS builders can utilize Q Developer’s integration with AWS Lambda to swiftly build event-driven logic. Q also supports the DevOps process through Amazon CodeCatalyst, assisting in many of its features such as pull requests and <span class="No-Break">code changes.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer is also aware of the AWS resources in your account and can easily list specific aspects of your resources through its conversational capability. It can also help you understand the cost of AWS <span class="No-Break">services used.</span></p>
			<p>Q Developer not only automates many development tasks within AWS but also aids builders in troubleshooting lambda code and understanding <span class="No-Break">networking-related issues.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, you <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>can consult Q for best practices and solutions for use cases. It can also recommend optimal EC2 instances for specific use cases. The chat capability of Q allows you to ask questions and receive responses easily, simplifying integrations with <span class="No-Break">AWS support.</span></p>
			<p>We will dive deeper into Q’s assistance with AWS services in the <em class="italic">Build on AWS with support from Amazon Q Developer</em> section later in this chapter. A more detailed exploration of these capabilities is also provided in separate chapters in <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of the book, where we explain real-world development use cases <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer provides many features, with some advanced options available in a Pro tier. In the following section, we will walk through both the free and Pro tiers and explain how you, as a user, can leverage each <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Amazon Q Developer tiers</h1>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer offers two tiers: free tier and Pro tier. Let’s quickly look at how these two tiers work and what features are available <span class="No-Break">in them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Amazon Q Developer free tier</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>free tier of Amazon Q Developer provides monthly limits for anyone logged in as an AWS IAM user or AWS Builder ID user. The specific features available to you depend on your interface and <span class="No-Break">authentication method.</span></p>
			<p>The best thing about the free tier is that anyone can use Amazon Q Developer in one of the supported IDEs they use for software development, even if they don’t use AWS services or don’t have an <span class="No-Break">AWS account.</span></p>
			<p>So, if you are reading this book and don’t have an AWS account set up, you can quickly set up an<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> AWS Builder ID using this link: <a href="https://profile.aws.amazon.com">https://profile.aws.amazon.com</a>. Your AWS Builder ID represents you as an individual and is separate from any credentials and data associated <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>with your existing AWS accounts. All you need is your personal email ID to quickly set <span class="No-Break">it up.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights my AWS Builder ID page once it is <span class="No-Break">set up.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer011">
					<img alt="Figure 2.2 – AWS Builder ID creation" src="image/B21378_02_002.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – AWS Builder ID creation</p>
			<p>Once your AWS Builder ID is created, you can log in to one of the supported IDEs. We will cover this part when we go through the IDE setup section later in <span class="No-Break">the chapter.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Amazon Q Developer Pro tier</h2>
			<p>To access <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>Amazon Q Developer Pro, you must be an IAM Identity Center user, and your administrator must subscribe you to Amazon Q Developer Pro. As a subscriber, your usage limits are determined at an individual user level in the Amazon Q Console, Q in the IDE, and Q in <span class="No-Break">Amazon CodeCatalyst.</span></p>
			<p>If you are part of an organization, then access to the Pro tier will be set up by the admin team. However, if you are reading this book and want to try out some of the capabilities of Amazon Q Developer that are only available in the Pro tier, you can do so as an individual AWS user <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>We will quickly guide you on one of the ways to access the Pro tier. Once you set up your AWS account, you will most likely assign yourself the admin role so that you can access all AWS services without provisioning additional privileges. However, if you are not the admin, make sure you have the admin role for the Amazon Q <span class="No-Break">Developer service.</span></p>
			<p>Once you log in<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> to the AWS console, search for and open the Amazon Q service page. The following screenshot shows the Q Developer Pro bundle available <span class="No-Break">for subscription.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer012">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Amazon Q Developer Pro bundle</p>
			<p>As soon as you hit <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong>, it will ask you to select a user or group from the IAM Identity Center to grant the pro subscription to. If you are a first-time user and your IAM Identity Center user is not set up, you will have to set it up before you can assign it, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer013">

			<p>Setting up users <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>in IAM Identity Center involves several tasks, and we have included a link to the setup instructions in the <em class="italic">References</em> section of this chapter. Once the user is ready, they will appear in the dropdown menu for you to search by name and assign in the previous step. During this setup process, IAM Identity Center will also configure Amazon Q in its application settings, where the identity source and authentication settings will <span class="No-Break">be found.</span></p>
			<p>Once you have assigned the user in the subscription screen, the Pro tier subscription will be active, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer014">

			<p>Now, let’s move on to our next topic: setting up Amazon Q Developer inside your <span class="No-Break">favorite IDEs.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Amazon Q Developer setup for third-party IDEs</h1>
			<p>An <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. Typically, an IDE includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Its purpose is to streamline the coding and development process by integrating various aspects of software development into a single environment, making it more efficient and convenient for developers. Popular examples of IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and <span class="No-Break">IntelliJ IDEA.</span></p>
			<p>To enhance developer productivity, Amazon Q Developer seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains IDEs. Each of these IDEs has its own strengths, and developers often have a favorite go-to IDE or switch around depending on the features they require for a particular programming language. We aim to demonstrate how to enable Q in all three of them and leave the choice to our <span class="No-Break">end users.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>VS Code</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Visual Studio</strong> <strong class="bold">Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">VS Code</strong>)<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> is a standalone source code editor compatible with Windows, macOS, and <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>Linux. It is<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> ideal for Java and web developers and offers many extensions to support virtually any <span class="No-Break">programming language.</span></p>
			<p>Once you install VS Code, to start using Q, you need to install the Amazon Q extension. You can install it either by searching the Extensions section of VS Code or by installing it via the VS Code Marketplace. For further assistance in installing and setting up the Q extension for VS Code, refer to the link provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Once the extension is installed, you need to authenticate yourself. If you are using the Amazon Q Pro tier as part of your organization, your AWS account administrator will setup and enable IAM Identity Center for you to authenticate. Basically, your administrator will add you as a user and provide you with a start URL for you to log in with IAM Identity Center so that you can leverage Q as part of the organizational <span class="No-Break">policies enabled.</span></p>
			<p>If you are using VS Code and want to use Amazon Q as a free tier user, then you need to log in using your AWS Builder ID. Once installed and authenticated, you will see the following screenshot, where the extension for Amazon Q is installed for VS Code, and you can see it being authenticated using the Builder ID at the bottom of <span class="No-Break">the screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer016">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Enabled and authenticated extension for Amazon Q Developer in VS Code</p>
			<p>Let’s quickly<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> see <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>how the authentication for the free and Pro tiers appears in VS Code. In the previous sections, we established an AWS Builder ID for the free tier and also set up an IAM Identity Center user who was provided with a subscription to the <span class="No-Break">Pro tier.</span></p>
			<p>After installing the Amazon Q extension, when you first try to authenticate to Q from the VS Code editor, you will be presented with both choices, free and Pro tier, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer017">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – Authentication options to Amazon Q Developer in VS Code</p>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>proceed <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>with the free tier, it will open a browser screen asking you to input your AWS Builder ID credentials. It will also ask you to confirm whether you approve giving the IDE access to your data through Amazon Q, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>

			<p>The setup for <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>JetBrains IDE is<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> identical so let’s quickly take a look at that. We will not repeat all the steps again since the process <span class="No-Break">is similar.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>JetBrains</h2>
			<p>JetBrains <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>provides a series of <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>IDEs, each with its own set of support for different programming languages. For example, Java <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>developers use IntelliJ Idea IDE whereas Python developers use PyCharm IDE. Similarly, JetBrains provides many other IDEs for other programming languages. Since we will be using Python as our primary language to describe different functionalities of Amazon Q, let’s set it up for <span class="No-Break">PyCharm IDE.</span></p>
			<p>We need to get the Amazon Q plugin for JetBrains installed and authenticated as we did for VS Code earlier. You can either install the plugin from the Plugins section of the IDE or from the JetBrains marketplace. To further assist you in installing and setting up the plugin for JetBrains IDE, refer to the link provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter, which also lists support for different JetBrains IDEs and their <span class="No-Break">specific versions.</span></p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>screenshot shows the<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> plugin for Amazon Q installed inside PyCharm IDE. Keep in mind to disable other AI assistants to avoid conflicting results. If PyCharm is what you use for Python coding, you are all set to jump in to <a href="B21378_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a> to start using Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>

			<p>Let’s look at another popular IDE that Amazon Q supports, <span class="No-Break">Visual Studio.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Visual Studio</h2>
			<p>Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>Studio 2022 is a<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> popular<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> IDE for Windows, catering to .NET and C++ developers. It excels in constructing web, cloud, desktop, mobile apps, services, <span class="No-Break">and games.</span></p>
			<p>For Amazon Q to work inside the Visual Studio IDE, you will need to install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio. From the Visual Studio Marketplace, first install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio, and then there are multiple ways to authenticate into the AWS account. For detailed instructions on setting up Amazon Q with Visual Studio, refer to the link provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of <span class="No-Break">the chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> supports C, C++, and C# as programming languages in Visual Studio. And support for<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> the command line is also available so let’s look at the initial setup of Amazon Q Developer for use with the <span class="No-Break">command line.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Amazon Q Developer setup for command line</h1>
			<p>In the age of<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> sophisticated IDEs, <strong class="bold">command-line interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLIs</strong>) are still very popular with developers for quick tests and builds. In <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of the book, we will look at how you can use Amazon Q Developer with command lines, but first, we need to ensure that Q is installed and set up for the <span class="No-Break">command line.</span></p>
			<p>Things are <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>constantly evolving, but currently, Amazon Q Developer for the command line is supported only with macOS. There are a handful of shells, terminal emulators, terminal IDEs, and over 500 CLIs supported. Always refer to the AWS documentation for newly <span class="No-Break">supported environments.</span></p>
			<p>Since we are using macOS with the zsh shell terminal, we will guide you through the installation steps <span class="No-Break">for it:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Download and install Amazon Q Developer for the command line. The link is in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the bottom of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></li>
				<li>If you have Pro-tier access provided by your organization, you will need an IAM Identity Centre start URL provided by your <span class="No-Break">organization’s administrators.</span></li>
				<li>If you are a free user, it will ask you to authenticate using your Builder ID or with IAM Identity Centre. AWS Builder ID is a personal profile that grants you access to Amazon Q Developer. Builder IDs are free, and you can sign up using your <span class="No-Break">email address.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once the installation is successful, the <strong class="bold">Automated checks</strong> section in Amazon Q should display checkmarks, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p>Now, let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>at the initial setup of <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>Amazon Q Developer with some of the supported AWS services <span class="No-Break">and tools.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Amazon Q Developer setup for AWS coding environments</h1>
			<p>If you are an<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> application builder, software developer, data engineer, or data scientist working with AWS services, you would frequently use builder-friendly tools such as Amazon SageMaker as a platform for building AI/ML projects, Amazon EMR as a platform for building big data processing<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> projects, AWS Glue for building <strong class="bold">extract, transform, and load</strong> (<strong class="bold">ETL</strong>) pipelines, and AWS Lambda as a serverless compute service. All these services provide tools that help builders and developers <span class="No-Break">write code.</span></p>
			<p>To simplify the developer experience with these AWS services, Amazon Q provides code suggestion and code generation features inside the supported AWS tools. Let’s explore all such tools and how to set <span class="No-Break">them up.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Amazon SageMaker Studio</h2>
			<p>Amazon SageMaker Studio is <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>a comprehensive platform featuring specialized tools for every<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> stage of <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) development. From data preparation to model building, training, deployment, and management, it <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>provides a seamless workflow. Upload data swiftly, construct models in your preferred IDE, enhance team collaboration, optimize coding with an AI-powered companion, fine-tune and debug models, deploy and manage them in production, and automate workflows—all effortlessly unified within a single <span class="No-Break">web-based interface.</span></p>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>enabling Q Developer to make Python code recommendations in SageMaker Studio, we assume that you have your SageMaker Studio environment up and running, with all the prerequisites completed and the SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Domain created.</span></p>
			<p>To proceed, in your SageMaker IAM execution role, just add the following IAM policy allowing Amazon Q to generate <span class="No-Break">code recommendations:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [

			<p class="callout">However, in the new experience, along with in-line prompts, you can also enable chat-style assistance from Amazon Q. The chat feature can only be enabled with the Pro tier of Amazon Q Developer, which requires the SageMaker domain to be integrated with IAM Identity Center.  </p>
			<p>To enable chat style feature of Amazon Q inside SageMaker Studio, you can enable Q in the <strong class="bold">App Configurations</strong> tab of the domain details as shown in the following screenshot. The Q Profile ARN can be found in the settings page of Amazon Q Developer as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>Now let’s switch gears and see how Amazon Q Developer can also assist AWS builders in building <span class="No-Break">solutions faster.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Build on AWS with support from Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>If you’re a builder in your <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>IT department and use AWS services to solve business use cases, then Amazon Q can help boost your productivity and enhance your experiences with AWS services. Amazon Q can be accessed from the AWS Management Console, the AWS website, and even within the AWS documentation to help you reach your desired end <span class="No-Break">goal faster.</span></p>
			<p>Before we explore some of the capabilities of Amazon Q on AWS, let’s review the permissions you may need in your AWS account before you can start <span class="No-Break">using it.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Amazon Q permissions</h2>
			<p>When a <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>user logs into the AWS console, they assume a role that has been granted certain permissions to use specific resources in the AWS services. For a user to utilize the features of Amazon Q, they must have permission to use Q features. To facilitate this, the role assumed by the user needs to have an IAM policy with Q permissions. The quickest and easiest way to get started is to attach the managed IAM policy to the role. <strong class="source-inline">AmazonQFullAccess</strong> is a managed IAM policy that provides full access to all features of <span class="No-Break">Amazon Q.</span></p>
			<p>This managed IAM policy contains wildcard (<strong class="source-inline">*</strong>) characters in actions and resources, allowing all features of Q to be used by all AWS resources. The following code snippet illustrates <span class="No-Break">this policy:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAmazonQFullAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "q:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}</pre>			<p>In your organization, the AWS account admin most probably won’t grant you full access. Typically, the wildcard character is replaced with actual actions and resources your role needs <span class="No-Break">access to.</span></p>
			<p>For example, to <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>allow users to utilize the conversational feature of Q, in the <strong class="source-inline">Action</strong> section, the <strong class="source-inline">*</strong> will be replaced with <strong class="source-inline">q:StartConversation</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">q:SendMessage</strong>. And to use the AWS console troubleshoot feature, the <strong class="source-inline">Action</strong> will have <strong class="source-inline">q:StartTroubleshootingAnalysis</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">q:GetTroubleshootingResults</strong>, and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">q:StartTroubleshootingResolutionExplanation</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> actions.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have the permissions sorted out, let’s explore some areas where Amazon Q can assist <span class="No-Break">on AWS.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Conversational Q&amp;A capability</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>allows you to ask conversational-style questions right inside the AWS Management Console itself. AWS builders <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>can ask a wide range of questions about architecture, services, best practices, and ask multiple follow-up questions too to get the desired guidance. Getting all the responses in the Q chat console cuts down the time needed for research and investigation, which in turn fast-tracks the application <span class="No-Break">build process.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights Q’s ability to provide context-based answers. The Amazon Q icon is in the top right corner of the console. We will explore many more conversational-style uses of Amazon Q for AWS in <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.22 – Working with Amazon Q inside the AWS console</p>
			<p>Amazon Q also<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> provides targeted assistance for AWS services such as Amazon Redshift and AWS Glue by using its conversational Q&amp;A capability. While <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>we will briefly cover them in this introductory chapter, a more detailed discussion will be provided in <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of the book, where we delve into chapters focused on the AWS <span class="No-Break">build process.</span></p>
			<h3>Chat to generate insights from Amazon Redshift</h3>
			<p>Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>Redshift is <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>a fully managed data warehousing service in the cloud, offering fast query performance using robust SQL-based analytics tools. It efficiently manages petabyte-scale data warehouses, enabling users to analyze large datasets and derive valuable insights for decision-making. The Amazon Redshift Query Editor is a <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>browser-based tool that allows users to run SQL queries directly against their Redshift <span class="No-Break">data warehouse.</span></p>
			<p>The Amazon Q generative SQL feature within the Amazon Redshift Query Editor generates SQL recommendations based on natural language prompts. This enhances productivity by assisting users in extracting insights more efficiently from <span class="No-Break">their data.</span></p>
			<p>The provided screenshot exemplifies how Amazon Q comprehended the query posed in the chat and effectively joined the various tables necessary to complete the SQL query. You can incorporate the generated query into the notebook and validate its accuracy by testing the query for <span class="No-Break">precise results.</span></p>

			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> feature would expedite report creation and enable non-technical users to derive insights from the data without having to wait for technical expertise to generate reports. We will delve into the details of this in <a href="B21378_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor210"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>. Now, let’s explore how Amazon Q can add value in AWS Glue notebooks, making it easier for data engineers to create <span class="No-Break">ETL jobs.</span></p>
			<h3>Chat to generate logic for AWS Glue ETL</h3>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> previous section, we discussed how Amazon Q can assist with auto-coding inside the Glue Studio notebook. However, sometimes you need to chat with the assistant to generate the boilerplate logic in its entirety. Using the Amazon Q chat capability simplifies job authoring, troubleshooting, and provides immediate responses to inquiries regarding AWS Glue and data integration tasks, significantly reducing time <span class="No-Break">and effort.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot demonstrates how, simply by providing Q with the use case, it was able to<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> generate the Glue code, which you can then copy into the Glue Studio notebook for testing. This significantly saves time for data engineers who prefer to create custom scripts for their <span class="No-Break">ETL jobs.</span></p>

			<p>Amazon Q can <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>now also understand Q&amp;A within the context of the resources created in your account. You can ask questions such as “Show all my EC2 instances running in the us-west-1 region,” and it will list them all for you. Amazon Q can also provide you with a cost breakdown of resources being used in the AWS account. You can ask questions such as “How much did we spend on Amazon Redshift in 2023 in the us-east-1 region?” and it will provide you with the <span class="No-Break">cost structure.</span></p>
			<p>For now, let’s explore some other important features of Amazon Q with various <span class="No-Break">AWS services.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Troubleshoot AWS console errors</h2>
			<p>AWS builders<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> spend a significant amount of time troubleshooting issues during their development process. Amazon Q makes it easy to identify and solve errors directly from the AWS console. Instead of manually checking logs and researching solutions to errors, Q proposes possible solutions with just a click of <span class="No-Break">a button.</span></p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, we have a simple AWS Lambda function that prints a message. But the sample code has <span class="No-Break">a bug.</span></p>

			<p>Everything <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>looks great, but we mistakenly ended the string inside the <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> statement with a double quote instead of a single quote. The error becomes apparent when we run the test, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>

			<p>Instead of manually combing through log files or researching the error on the internet, you can simply click the <strong class="bold">Troubleshoot with Amazon Q</strong> button on the test screen itself. Q will provide an analysis of the issue, and you can also ask it to provide a resolution. The<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> following screenshot shows the analysis and resolution of the missing <span class="No-Break">single quote.</span></p>

			<p>In <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of the book, we will look into details other on how to troubleshoot other complicated issues while building solutions using <span class="No-Break">AWS services.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Troubleshoot networking issues</h2>
			<p>Every<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> application builder and developer knows how nightmarish it can be to deal with networking issues. To alleviate this frustration, Amazon Q can also help troubleshoot networking issues. Amazon Q works in tandem with Amazon VPC’s Reachability Analyzer to check networking connections and identify potential <span class="No-Break">configuration issues.</span></p>
			<p>For example, in <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>the following screenshot, you can see that by simply asking a connectivity question to Q, it was able to suggest possible <span class="No-Break">network issues.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer037">
					<img alt="Figure 2.2﻿8 – Amazon Q networking troubleshoot" src="image/B21378_02_028.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.28 – Amazon Q networking troubleshoot</p>
			<p>After Q identifies that the issue arises due to a network connectivity problem, it then utilizes Amazon VPC’s Reachability Analyzer to analyze the full networking path, pinpointing where the issue might be occurring along the route. The following screenshot shows the path analysis from source to destination and suggests potential locations for <span class="No-Break">the issue.</span></p>

			<p>Let’s move on to<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> see some more capabilities of Amazon Q <span class="No-Break">on AWS.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Optimal selection of Amazon EC2 instances</h2>
			<p>AWS builders <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>are well familiar with <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>) instances as many of them use servers to deploy and run their applications. However, with so many different types of EC2 instances, it is difficult to know which type of instance would be best suitable for a particular workload. Of course, you can research it and choose the best one, but Amazon Q makes it easy to select the best EC2 for the job, right from the EC2 <span class="No-Break">console itself.</span></p>
			<p>Inside the EC2 console, where you get to choose an instance type, Amazon Q comes in handy when you click the <strong class="bold">Get advice</strong> link as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer039">
					<img alt="Figure 2.3﻿0 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance type advise" src="image/B21378_02_030.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.30 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance type advise</p>
			<p>You can then <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>choose your use case, workload type, priority, and CPU types, which make up the input to Amazon Q as it advises the best possible EC2 instances to use. The following screenshot shows the criteria selection section once you seek advice <span class="No-Break">from Q.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer040">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.31 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance type selection criteria</p>
			<p>Once you hit the <strong class="bold">Get instance type advice</strong> button, Q works its magic. The following screenshot shows the instances to use for the input criteria we provided, and it also explains what each of these EC2 instances brings to the table. It lists the sources from where the information is taken so that anyone can look at the original source <span class="No-Break">of truth.</span></p>

			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>wind down this introductory chapter about Amazon Q, let’s quickly look at another key aspect around <span class="No-Break">feature development.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Assist with AWS Support cases</h2>
			<p>You can use <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>Amazon Q Developer to create a support case and contact AWS Support from anywhere in the AWS Management Console, including the AWS Support Center Console. Amazon Q leverages the context of your conversation to automatically draft a support case on your behalf, incorporating your recent conversation into the support case description. Once the case is created, Amazon Q can connect you to a support agent through your preferred method, including live chat within the <span class="No-Break">same interface.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Assist during DevOps process in Amazon CodeCatalyst</h2>
			<p>Amazon CodeCatalyst<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> is a service that offers development teams a unified software development service to rapidly construct, deploy, and expand applications on AWS, all while maintaining organization-specific <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q’s feature development capability in Amazon CodeCatalyst acts as a generative AI assistant to which you can assign issues. Once an issue is assigned, Amazon Q analyzes its title and description, reviews the code in the specified repository, and, if possible, drafts a solution. This draft solution is then presented to users for evaluation in a <span class="No-Break">pull request.</span></p>
			<p>We have a whole chapter on this topic in <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of the book, so we will keep this introduction <span class="No-Break">short here.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered what Amazon Q Developer is and how it can assist developers and application builders in their day-to-day tasks. We also briefly explored some of its features, along with considerations for setting <span class="No-Break">it up.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we walked through the setup of Amazon Q for command-line interfaces, external IDEs such as VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, as well as AWS services, IDEs, and notebooks such as Amazon SageMaker Studio, Amazon EMR Studio, AWS Glue Studio, and <span class="No-Break">AWS Lambda.</span></p>
			<p>We examined its benefits for AWS builders, highlighting how Amazon Q can be leveraged from the AWS console itself to assist with various activities. On a high level, we covered how Amazon Q can help with conversational Q&amp;A style chat, console issues, network troubleshooting, EC2 instance selection, and also during the DevOps process in <span class="No-Break">Amazon CodeCatalyst.</span></p>
			<p>In the upcoming chapters in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of the book, we will delve into detail about auto code generation techniques and how Amazon Q Developer can assist developers in <span class="No-Break">this process.</span></p>
