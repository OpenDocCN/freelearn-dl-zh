    of images using various techniques. You will be introduced to the Rekognition
    service for image analysis using computer vision, through which you will be able
    to detect objects and scenes in images. You will learn how to analyze faces and
    recognize celebrities in images. You will also be able to compare faces in different
    images to see how closely they match with each other.

    with the **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**)
    and **Machine Learning** (**ML**) services. You combined the serverless computing
    paradigm and conversational AI to construct chatbots, as well as a fully functional
    contact center that enables anyone to converse with the chatbots through a voice
    interface that's available by dialing a local phone number. You also learned about
    text analysis and topic modeling, all using the AWS services.

    image processing tasks. First, you will identify objects and scenes within images.
    Then, you will test whether images should be flagged as needing content moderation.
    Next, you will analyze faces using Rekognition. You will also recognize celebrities
    and well-known people in images. You will compare faces that appear in different
    images and settings (for example, in groups or isolation) and recognize the same
    people in different images. Finally, you will extract text from images that might
    have some text displayed in them.

    that allows you to perform image analysis on pictures and videos using machine
    learning. It is built on the same scalable infrastructure as AWS itself and uses
    deep learning technology to be able to analyze billions of images daily if required.
    It is also being updated constantly by Amazon and is learning new labels and features.

    the system. The exact details are proprietary and confidential to Amazon, but
    we will learn how it works and how to use Rekognition in this chapter. As we mentioned
    earlier, one interesting aspect of Amazon Rekognition is the fact that the algorithms
    are monitored and trained periodically to increase their accuracy and capabilities.
    It can also be extended with custom labels and models trained with your images.

    machines as they do not have the capability to reason or perform semantic analysis.
    The image analysis domain is relatively new, with the bulk of advances coming
    in the last 5 to 6 years. New algorithms are being researched, new ways of training
    are being explored, and optimizations are being sought. Therefore, Amazon Rekognition
    is extremely effectiveâit has wrapped the algorithms and mechanisms in a set of
    useful and practical interfaces, masking the underlying algorithmic and computer
    theoretic complexities, and Rekognition learns and evolves by leveraging the current
    best practices and research. In this section, you were introduced to the capabilities
    of Amazon Rekognition's image analysis service. You will see more regarding this

    Rekognition to analyze faces inside an arrangement of pictures with different

    picture (that is, the reference) with up to 100 countenances recognized in the
    objective picture (that is, the examination images) and, after that, discovers
    how intently the face in the source picture matches with the appearances in the

    such as tax returns and company statements. Amazon Rekognition can detect and
    extract text from images as wellâfor example, street signs, posters, product names,
    and license plates. Of course, this feature is made to work with real-world images
    instead of document images. The `Text in image` link, which is accessible from
    the left toolbar, is where this capability resides in Amazon Rekognition.

    along with a confidence score. This can be extremely useful for searching text
    across a collection of images. Each image can be tagged with the corresponding
    text metadata based on the results from this and other capabilities of the service.

    words in separate regions. Even though the sign's font is unique, with shadows,
