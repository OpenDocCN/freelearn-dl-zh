    of images using various techniques. You will be introduced to the Rekognition
    service for image analysis using computer vision, through which you will be able
    to detect objects and scenes in images. You will learn how to analyze faces and
    recognize celebrities in images. You will also be able to compare faces in different
    images to see how closely they match with each other.

  zh: 简介
- en: In the preceding chapters, you have done lots of interesting exercises and activities
    with the **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**)
    and **Machine Learning** (**ML**) services. You combined the serverless computing
    paradigm and conversational AI to construct chatbots, as well as a fully functional
    contact center that enables anyone to converse with the chatbots through a voice
    interface that's available by dialing a local phone number. You also learned about
    text analysis and topic modeling, all using the AWS services.

- en: In this chapter, you will use the Amazon Rekognition service to perform various
    image processing tasks. First, you will identify objects and scenes within images.
    Then, you will test whether images should be flagged as needing content moderation.
    Next, you will analyze faces using Rekognition. You will also recognize celebrities
    and well-known people in images. You will compare faces that appear in different
    images and settings (for example, in groups or isolation) and recognize the same
    people in different images. Finally, you will extract text from images that might
    have some text displayed in them.

    analysis capabilities, which we enhance as we grow. But this is very hard for
    machines as they do not have the capability to reason or perform semantic analysis.
    The image analysis domain is relatively new, with the bulk of advances coming
    in the last 5 to 6 years. New algorithms are being researched, new ways of training
    are being explored, and optimizations are being sought. Therefore, Amazon Rekognition
    is extremely effective—it has wrapped the algorithms and mechanisms in a set of
    useful and practical interfaces, masking the underlying algorithmic and computer
    theoretic complexities, and Rekognition learns and evolves by leveraging the current
    best practices and research. In this section, you were introduced to the capabilities
    of Amazon Rekognition's image analysis service. You will see more regarding this

    picture (that is, the reference) with up to 100 countenances recognized in the
    objective picture (that is, the examination images) and, after that, discovers
    how intently the face in the source picture matches with the appearances in the

    is something you should be aware of and watch out for in your results. It is possible
    for Rekognition to get confused and return spurious results.

    images, even with different angles, fonts, shadows, and so forth. You should try
    this feature out with multiple images with different angles, lighting, and sizes.

    service and applied this to images. First, you used the service to recognize objects
    and scenes in images. Next, you moderated images that might have objectionable
    content by using Rekognition to recognize the objectionable content in the images.

    The nature of machine learning and artificial intelligence is such that immense
    strides have been made, and will continue to be made in the foreseeable future,
    in terms of what computers are going to be able to do—and AWS will be able to
    provide these services for you and your applications.
