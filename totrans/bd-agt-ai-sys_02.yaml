    adaptability, and interaction. Self-governance refers to the ability of a system
    or entity to govern or control itself autonomously, without external direction
    or control. In the context of agentic systems, self-governance implies that the
    system can make its own decisions, set its own goals, and regulate its behavior
    based on its internal rules, models, and decision-making algorithms. Basically,
    they operate according to their rules and internal states, and execute a change
    of behavior, if necessary, due to a change of the environment or the objectives.
    Such systems interact with the environment or other systems in a way that is meaningful
    to them and, through these interactions, become influenced.

    the tickets, and any other restrictions given by the user such as preferred seat
    class and so on, and then making decisions on how to optimally look for flights
    and hotels that meet those criteria so that it minimizes the overall cost of travel
    for the customer. The system would be responsible for the outcome of its decisions,

    to carry out tasks such as booking flights or hotels, managing reminders, and
    retrieving travel information with little or no human input. It would also possess
    functional autonomy, allowing it to interpret user commands, adapt to individual
    preferences, and make decisions that align with the user’s goals and context.
    The level of hierarchical autonomy granted to such a system might depend on factors
    such as user privacy preferences or the system’s access to sensitive data and
    resources.

    absence of human oversight or control. Often, these systems operate within well-defined
    boundaries and constraints set by their designers or operators, while still exhibiting
    a significant degree of autonomy. In our travel booking example, the chatbot requests
    additional information, such as travel dates, locations, name, and address, from
    the user to make flight bookings. It then cross-references this data with available
    flights, suggesting options that match the user’s preferences. If any detail is
    missing or unclear, the chatbot prompts the user for clarification, ensuring accuracy
    while still operating autonomously within the boundaries set by its programming.

    the agent uses to make decisions.
  prefs:

    adds a new goal **G** to the agent’s list of goals. This is akin to the agent
    taking on objectives on behalf of the user. This is indicated by **A.goals.Append(G)**
    . Think of this as the piece of code that will receive the user’s chat message,

    a flight from San Diego to Seattle.

    updates the agent’s knowledge base with a new key-value pair (map or dictionary).
    This represents agency through the acquisition of information that will be used
    to act on behalf of the user. It also supports autonomy by providing the agent
    with information it can use to make independent decisions. This operation is represented
    as **A.knowledge_base[K] ← V** . In our case, this function uses several travel-related
    APIs (in theory) to get flight options between two cities, thus forming the knowledge
    into a knowledge base. This is also a place where each of these flight options
    will be scored; for example, late flights get low scores, and early flights get
    higher scores.

    together, starting from setting the goal of flight booking using the departure

    functionality of agency and autonomy, is not intelligent. It cannot take plain
    text messages from a user and decipher what the user intends to do to set its
    goals, update its knowledge base, and then perform the actions; rather, it needs

- en: The full Python code related to this algorithm can be found in the **Chapter_02.ipynb**
    Python notebook in GitHub repository. Keep in mind, just like before, our MAS
    is not very intelligent since it still needs discreet input, that is, departure
    city code and arrival city code, to operate successfully, and lacks the a bility
    to comprehend or infer values and actions from user messages or text.

- en: In this chapter, we explored the intriguing world of agentic systems and intelligent
    agents, delving into the core concepts of agency, autonomy, and the characteristics
    that define an ideal agent. We studied various architectural patterns for designing
    and implementing such systems, including deliberative, reactive, and hybrid approaches.
    Additionally, we examined MASs, where multiple agents collaborate and coordinate
    to achieve collective goals through mechanisms such as cooperation, coordination,
    and negotiation.

    intelligent and autonomous systems capable of operating effectively in complex,
    unpredictable environments. You should now be able to decide which agentic system
    architecture best suits any particular use case, and be able to craft a mental
    model of a MAS that gives you the foundation of your agentic system. In the next
    chapter, we will dive deeper into the essentials of an a gentic system, further
    strengthening our ability to build efficient systems.

    with real-time responsiveness in dynamic environments. Reactive architectures
    are well suited for dynamic environments requiring rapid responses but lack long-term
    planning and abstract reasoning capabilities.

    that interact, cooperate, and coordinate to achieve collective goals. Key characteristics
    include autonomy, interaction, adaptability, distributed control, scalability,
    heterogeneity, and decentralized data and knowledge.
