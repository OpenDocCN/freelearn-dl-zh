    **adversarial examples** in LLMs. Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs
    designed to intentionally mislead the model into producing incorrect or unexpected
    outputs. You’ll learn about textual adversarial attacks, methods to generate these
    examples, and techniques to make your models more robust. We’ll also cover evaluation
    methods and discuss the real-world implications of adversarial attacks on LLMs.

    performance. Accuracy represents the overall proportion of correctly classified
    instances out of the total number of instances. A high accuracy on clean data
    indicates the model performs well on original, unperturbed inputs, while a low
    accuracy suggests poor general performance. Conversely, a high accuracy on adversarial
    data implies the model is robust against the specific type of attack used, meaning
    the attacks are not very effective at fooling the model. A low accuracy on adversarial
    data, despite potentially high clean accuracy, highlights the model’s vulnerability
    to these attacks. The F1 score, particularly the weighted version used here to
    account for potential class imbalance, provides a balanced measure of precision
    and recall. A high F1 score on clean data signifies good performance in terms
    of both correctly identifying positive instances and avoiding false positives.
    Similarly, a high F1 score on adversarial data indicates robustness, as the model
    maintains good precision and recall even under attack. A low F1 score on either
    clean or adversarial data suggests the model struggles with either precision or
    recall, or both, in those respective conditions. Comparing the clean and adversarial
    scores reveals the extent to which the attacks degrade the model’s performance;
    a significant drop indicates a lack of robustness.
