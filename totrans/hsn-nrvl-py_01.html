<p>This section introduces core concepts of evolutionary computation and discusses particulars of neuroevolution-based algorithms and which Python libraries can be used to implement them. You will become familiar with the fundamentals of neuroevolution methods and will get practical recommendations on how to start your experiments. This section provides a basic introduction to the Anaconda package manager for Python as part of your environment setup.<br/>
