<p class="normal">More than five years ago, before the widespread adoption of generative AI, we were searching for new ways to enhance application development and user experiences. A few years later, we found ourselves deeply immersed in the world of generative AI, which has opened countless possibilities for innovation. Before discovering the transformative potential of this technology, we, the authors, explored various machine learning techniques, experimenting with different models and reading countless research papers. With generative AI, we found more than just a powerful tool; we discovered a new paradigm that is reshaping how we approach software development and problem-solving.</p>
<p class="normal">This book is about sharing the excitement and insights we have gained while exploring and implementing generative AI solutions. It is intended to guide you through the wide world of generative AI applications, with a focus on practical design patterns and real-world implementations. We will cover concepts ranging from basic to advanced, taking you on a journey like the one I experienced while learning to harness the power of generative AI.</p>
