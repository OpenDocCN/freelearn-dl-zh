    we will cover a step-by-step implementation of a conversational application, using
    LangChain and its components, building on the knowledge you’ve gained from the
    previous chapters. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to set up your

- en: A conversational application is a type of software that can interact with users
    using natural language. It can be used for various purposes, such as providing
    information, assistance, entertainment, or transactions. Generally speaking, a
    conversational application can use different modes of communication, such as text,
    voice, graphics, or even touch. A conversational application can also use different
    platforms, such as messaging apps, websites, mobile devices, or smart speakers.

    It is designed to be easy and fast to use, without requiring any front-end experience

    add widgets, charts, tables, and other elements.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    initial integration and its future plans with LangChain. At the core of this initial
    integration, there is the ambition of making it easier to build a GUI for conversational
    applications, as well as showing all the steps LangChain’s agents take before
    producing the final response.
  id: totrans-118
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To achieve this goal, the main module that Streamlit introduced is the Streamlit
    callback handler. This module provides a class called `StreamlitCallbackHandler`
    that implements the `BaseCallbackHandler` interface from LangChain. This class
    can handle various events that occur during the execution of a LangChain pipeline,
    such as tool start, tool end, tool error, LLM token, agent action, agent finish,
    etc.
  id: totrans-119
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The class can also create and update Streamlit elements, such as containers,
    expanders, text, progress bars, etc., to display the output of the pipeline in
    a user-friendly way. You can use the Streamlit callback handler to create Streamlit
    apps that showcase the capabilities of LangChain and interact with the user through
    natural language. For example, you can create an app that takes a user prompt
    and runs it through an agent that uses different tools and models to generate
    a response. You can use the Streamlit callback handler to show the agent’s thought
    process and the results of each tool in real time.

- en: In this chapter, we approached the end-to-end implementation of a conversational
    application, leveraging LangChain’s modules and progressively adding layers of
    complexity. We started with a plain vanilla chatbot with no memory, then moved
    on to more complex systems with the ability to keep traces of past interactions.
    We’ve also seen how to add non-parametric knowledge to our application with external
    tools, making it more “agentic” so that it is able to determine which tool to
    use, depending on the user’s query. Finally, we introduced Streamlit as the front-end
    framework to build the web app for our GlobeBotter.

    value and demonstrate emerging behaviors, that is, recommendation systems.
