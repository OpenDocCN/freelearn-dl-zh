			<p>The media attention around deepfakes often focuses on the ills and dangers of the technology. Even many of the articles about what deepfakes can do fail to account for why you might want to do it. The truth is that deepfakes bring new techniques and abilities to neural networks for those who know how to use them.</p>
			<p>Beyond replacing faces, deepfakes provide insights into all areas of generative AI, especially when traditional methods fall short. Join us as we explore what deepfakes are, what they can be used for, and how they may change in the future.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>A manifesto for the ethical use of deepfakes</h1>
			<p>There are a lot of concerns when it comes to the use of deepfakes. To that end, we have to establish some common ground so that we can communicate and discuss deepfake technology:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deepfakes are not for creating inappropriate content</li>
				<li>Deepfakes are not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding their use</li>
				<li>Deepfakes are not to be utilized for any illicit, unethical, or questionable purposes</li>
				<li>Deepfakes exist to experiment with and discover AI techniques, for social or political commentary, movies, and any number of other ethical and reasonable uses</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are very troubled by the fact that Faceswap has been used in unethical and disreputable ways. However, we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically, as well as providing education and experience in AI for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone using Faceswap for any unethical purposes and actively discourage any such uses.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for anyone interested in learning about deepfakes. From academics to researchers to content creators to developers, we’ve written this book so it has something for everybody.</p>
			<p>The early chapters will cover the essential background of deepfakes, how they work, their ethics, and how to make one yourself using free software that you can download and use without any technical knowledge.</p>
			<p>The middle chapters will go in depth into the exact methodology that deepfakes use to work, including working code that you can run and follow step-by-step as we get hands-on with the major processes of deepfakes: extraction, training, and conversion.</p>
			<p>The final chapters will look at where you can go from there. They cover how to use deepfake techniques in your own tasks, and where the technology might go in the future.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book is designed to build knowledge as you read through the chapters. If you’re starting with no background knowledge of deepfakes, then we suggest you start at the beginning. If you want to skip straight to the code, then you’ll want to look at <em class="italic">Part 2</em> (though we hope you’ll give <em class="italic">Part 1</em> a peruse once you’re ready). If you only care about what you can do with the techniques moving forward, then check out <em class="italic">Part 3</em> (but I promise that the earlier parts have some juicy nuggets of information).</p>
			<p>We use Python for all code examples in this book. If you know Python, you should be able to understand all the code samples with the help of the text. If you don’t know Python, then don’t worry! There is a lot of non-code explanation, and even the code includes hands-on explanations of what is going on in it.</p>
			<p>All the libraries used in this book are explained when they’re used, but this book should not be considered a guide or in-depth explanation of any of the libraries. Many of these libraries have books of their own dedicated to them, and their use in this book is solely functional.</p>

		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Part 1: Understanding Deepfakes</h1>
			<p>Deepfakes are a new (and controversial) technique using generative AI. But despite the basic idea that they swap one face with another, how much do you really know about deepfakes?</p>
			<p>It’s normal to have questions about something such as deepfakes, and this section will address those questions. We’ll start with the basics of how they work and the machine learning principles that deepfakes are built on, and then take a look at what software is available to make deepfakes. After that, we’ll examine the ethics of deepfakes, including the unsavory beginnings, and build a framework of sorts to evaluate how to make ethical deepfakes. Then, we’ll look at the most important part of creating a deepfake: data, including explanations of what makes good data and how to get the most from your (not-so-great) data. Finally, we’ll walk you through a complete deepfake using Faceswap, an open source deepfake program.</p>
			<p>By the end of this part, you’ll have a good understanding of what makes a deepfake, how they work, and even how to make one for yourself.</p>
			<p>This part comprises the following chapters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="B17535_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Surveying Deepfakes</em></li>

				<li><a href="B17535_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Acquiring and Processing Data</em></li>
