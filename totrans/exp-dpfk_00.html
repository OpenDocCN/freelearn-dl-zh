			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>The media attention around deepfakes often focuses on the ills and dangers of the technology. Even many of the articles about what deepfakes can do fail to account for why you might want to do it. The truth is that deepfakes bring new techniques and abilities to neural networks for those who know how to <span class="No-Break">use them.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond replacing faces, deepfakes provide insights into all areas of generative AI, especially when traditional methods fall short. Join us as we explore what deepfakes are, what they can be used for, and how they may change in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>A manifesto for the ethical use of deepfakes</h1>
			<p>There are a lot of concerns when it comes to the use of deepfakes. To that end, we have to establish some common ground so that we can communicate and discuss <span class="No-Break">deepfake technology:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deepfakes are not for creating inappropriate content</li>
				<li>Deepfakes are not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding their use</li>
				<li>Deepfakes are not to be utilized for any illicit, unethical, or questionable purposes</li>
				<li>Deepfakes exist to experiment with and discover AI techniques, for social or political commentary, movies, and any number of other ethical and reasonable uses</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are very troubled by the fact that Faceswap has been used in unethical and disreputable ways. However, we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically, as well as providing education and experience in AI for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone using Faceswap for any unethical purposes and actively discourage any <span class="No-Break">such uses.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for anyone interested in learning about deepfakes. From academics to researchers to content creators to developers, we’ve written this book so it has something <span class="No-Break">for everybody.</span></p>
			<p>The early chapters will cover the essential background of deepfakes, how they work, their ethics, and how to make one yourself using free software that you can download and use without any <span class="No-Break">technical knowledge.</span></p>
			<p>The middle chapters will go in depth into the exact methodology that deepfakes use to work, including working code that you can run and follow step-by-step as we get hands-on with the major processes of deepfakes: extraction, training, <span class="No-Break">and conversion.</span></p>
			<p>The final chapters will look at where you can go from there. They cover how to use deepfake techniques in your own tasks, and where the technology might go in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book is designed to build knowledge as you read through the chapters. If you’re starting with no background knowledge of deepfakes, then we suggest you start at the beginning. If you want to skip straight to the code, then you’ll want to look at <em class="italic">Part 2</em> (though we hope you’ll give <em class="italic">Part 1</em> a peruse once you’re ready). If you only care about what you can do with the techniques moving forward, then check out <em class="italic">Part 3</em> (but I promise that the earlier parts have some juicy nuggets <span class="No-Break">of information).</span></p>
			<p>We use Python for all code examples in this book. If you know Python, you should be able to understand all the code samples with the help of the text. If you don’t know Python, then don’t worry! There is a lot of non-code explanation, and even the code includes hands-on explanations of what is going on <span class="No-Break">in it.</span></p>
			<p>All the libraries used in this book are explained when they’re used, but this book should not be considered a guide or in-depth explanation of any of the libraries. Many of these libraries have books of their own dedicated to them, and their use in this book is <span class="No-Break">solely functional.</span></p>

If you want to follow along, we highly recommend you install it from the site listed here. If you would rather use Python virtual environments, you may, but if you do, the instructions in this book will not always work without modification, especially installing the necessary packages. If you choose to use that route, you will have to find the correct version of libraries to <span class="No-Break">install yourself.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section).

			<p>Included in each hands-on chapter is a list of exercises. Please don’t take these as directions on what you must do, but consider them as helpers to more completely understand what it is that the code is doing and how you can use the techniques for yourself. They do not have “answers” as they are not really questions; they’re just prompts for you to find new and exciting ways to apply <span class="No-Break">your knowledge.</span></p>
			<p>If you do complete any of the exercises (or come up with something impressive of your own), we’d appreciate it if you would “fork” the book’s repo into your own GitHub account and show the world your accomplishment!

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Part 1: Understanding Deepfakes</h1>
			<p>Deepfakes are a new (and controversial) technique using generative AI. But despite the basic idea that they swap one face with another, how much do you really know <span class="No-Break">about deepfakes?</span></p>
			<p>It’s normal to have questions about something such as deepfakes, and this section will address those questions. We’ll start with the basics of how they work and the machine learning principles that deepfakes are built on, and then take a look at what software is available to make deepfakes. After that, we’ll examine the ethics of deepfakes, including the unsavory beginnings, and build a framework of sorts to evaluate how to make ethical deepfakes. Then, we’ll look at the most important part of creating a deepfake: data, including explanations of what makes good data and how to get the most from your (not-so-great) data. Finally, we’ll walk you through a complete deepfake using Faceswap, an open source <span class="No-Break">deepfake program.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this part, you’ll have a good understanding of what makes a deepfake, how they work, and even how to make one <span class="No-Break">for yourself.</span></p>
			<p>This part comprises the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>
