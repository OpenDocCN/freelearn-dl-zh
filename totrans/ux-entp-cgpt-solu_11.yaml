- en: In the last phase of your journey, we’ll explore the tools and resources needed
    to understand how the LLM is performing and what to look for to fix it if it isn’t
    up to expectations. You’ll first learn how to apply existing guidelines and heuristics
    that can be used in ways you didn’t expect to craft LLM solutions. We’ll even
    give you the skills to adapt web and traditional design thinking to conversational
    AI. Then, you’ll dive into understanding how to monitor and evaluate solutions
    based on industry AI and user experience metrics, covering objective and subjective
    performance measures in the care and feeding process. The lifecycle of an LLM
    solution demands good business processes to be successful. Best practices that
    can work at the most prominent enterprises are shared to help create effective
    methods for creating world-class LLM solutions.
