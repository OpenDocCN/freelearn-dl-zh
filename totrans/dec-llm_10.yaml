    biases in LLMs, legal challenges in LLM deployment and usage, regulatory landscape
    and compliance, and ethical considerations. We will provide you with business
    case studies from which you will learn the concept of ROI. Additionally, you will
    see a survey of the landscape of AI tools, a comparison between open source and
    proprietary tools, an explanation of how to integrate LLMs with existing software
    stacks, and an exploration of the role of cloud providers in NLP. You will learn
    about what to expect from the next generation of LLMs and how to get ready for
    GPT-5 and beyond. We will conclude with key takeaways from this guide, the future
    trajectory of LLMs in NLP, and final thoughts about the LLM revolution.
