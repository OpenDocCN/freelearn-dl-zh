    capability, more and more researchers have started looking for alternative approaches
    to train artificial neural networks.

- en: Deep machine learning is extremely effective for pattern recognition, but fails
    in tasks that require an understanding of context or previously unseen data. Many
    researchers, including Geoff Hinton, the father of the modern incarnation of deep
    machine learning, agree that the current approach to designing artificial intelligence
    systems is no longer able to cope with the challenges currently being faced.

- en: In this book, we discuss a viable alternative to traditional deep machine learning
    methods—neuroevolution algorithms. Neuroevolution is a family of machine learning
    methods that use evolutionary algorithms to ease the solving of complex tasks
    such as games, robotics, and the simulation of natural processes. Neuroevolution
    algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. Very simple artificial
    neural networks can evolve to become very complex. The ultimate result of neuroevolution
    is the optimal topology of a network, which makes the model more energy-efficient
    and more convenient to analyze.

    and get practical skills in using them to solve different computer science problems—from
    classic reinforcement learning to building agents for autonomous navigation through
    a labyrinth. Also, you will learn how neuroevolution can be used to train deep
    neural networks to create an agent that can play classic Atari games.

- en: This book aims to give you a solid understanding of neuroevolution methods by
    implementing various experiments using step-by-step guidance. It covers practical
    examples in areas such as games, robotics, and the simulation of natural processes,
    using real-world examples and datasets to help you better understand the concepts
    explored. After reading this book, you will have everything you need to apply
    neuroevolution methods to other tasks similar to the experiments presented.

- en: In writing this book, my goal is to provide you with knowledge of cutting-edge
    technology that is a vital alternative to traditional deep learning. I hope that
    the application of neuroevolution algorithms in your projects will allow you to
    solve your currently intractable problems in an elegant and energy-efficient way.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for machine learning practitioners, deep learning researchers,
    and AI enthusiasts who are looking to implement neuroevolution algorithms from
    scratch. You will learn how to apply these algorithms to various sets of real-world
    problems. You will learn how neuroevolution methods can optimize the process of
    training artificial neural networks. You will become familiar with the core concepts
    of neuroevolution and get the necessary practical skills to use it in your work
    and experiments. A working knowledge of Python and deep learning and neural network
    basics is mandatory.

    with the examples presented in this book. For better source code understanding,
    it is preferable to use an IDE that supports Python syntax highlighting and code
    reference location. If you don't have one installed, you can use Microsoft Visual
    Studio Code. It is free and cross-platform, and you can download it here: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).
