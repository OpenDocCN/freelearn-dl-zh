  zh: 前言
- en: With conventional deep learning methods almost hitting a wall in terms of their
    capability, more and more researchers have started looking for alternative approaches
    to train artificial neural networks.

  zh: 随着传统深度学习方法在能力上几乎达到极限，越来越多的研究人员开始寻找训练人工神经网络的替代方法。
- en: Deep machine learning is extremely effective for pattern recognition, but fails
    in tasks that require an understanding of context or previously unseen data. Many
    researchers, including Geoff Hinton, the father of the modern incarnation of deep
    machine learning, agree that the current approach to designing artificial intelligence
    systems is no longer able to cope with the challenges currently being faced.

  zh: 深度机器学习在模式识别方面非常有效，但在需要理解上下文或以前未见过的数据任务中却失败了。包括深度机器学习现代形态之父杰夫·辛顿在内的许多研究人员都认为，目前设计人工智能系统的方法已经无法应对当前面临的挑战。
- en: In this book, we discuss a viable alternative to traditional deep machine learning
    methods—neuroevolution algorithms. Neuroevolution is a family of machine learning
    methods that use evolutionary algorithms to ease the solving of complex tasks
    such as games, robotics, and the simulation of natural processes. Neuroevolution
    algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. Very simple artificial
    neural networks can evolve to become very complex. The ultimate result of neuroevolution
    is the optimal topology of a network, which makes the model more energy-efficient
    and more convenient to analyze.

  zh: 在这本书中，我们讨论了传统深度机器学习方法的可行替代方案——神经进化算法。神经进化是一系列使用进化算法来简化解决复杂任务（如游戏、机器人和自然过程模拟）的机器学习方法。神经进化算法受到自然选择过程的启发。非常简单的人工神经网络可以进化成非常复杂的网络。神经进化的最终结果是网络的优化拓扑结构，这使得模型更加节能且便于分析。
- en: Throughout this book, you will learn about various neuroevolution algorithms
    and get practical skills in using them to solve different computer science problems—from
    classic reinforcement learning to building agents for autonomous navigation through
    a labyrinth. Also, you will learn how neuroevolution can be used to train deep
    neural networks to create an agent that can play classic Atari games.
