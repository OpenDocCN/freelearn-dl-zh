     Preface
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Since its very beginnings,
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      artificial intelligence
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      AI
     
    </strong>
    
     ) has transformed the landscape of game development, offering players enriched and immersive experiences that were once thought to be the realm of science fiction.
    
    
     Unlike other methods of game development, where scripted events dictate more rigid player interactions, AI introduces a level of unpredictability and responsiveness that brings virtual worlds
    
    
     
      to life.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In recent years, advancements in AI technology have made it more accessible and easier to implement, resulting in a surge of intelligent gameplay across various genres.
    
    
     This evolution has made AI a cornerstone of modern game development, with millions of players benefiting from smarter, more engaging interactions in their favorite games
    
    
     
      every day.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Unreal Engine stands out as an advanced platform for developers looking to harness the power of AI in their projects.
    
    
     With a robust suite of tools and features tailored specifically for AI development – such as behavior trees and the Navigation System – Unreal Engine enables creators to build sophisticated AI systems that enhance gameplay and
    
    
     
      player engagement.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     If you’re ready to explore the world of AI development and its potential to improve your games, then there’s no better time to
    
    
     
      dive in!

     Who this book is for
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     If you are a game programmer, or specifically an Unreal Engine developer, with little or no knowledge of video game AI systems, and want to delve deep into this topic, then this book is
    
    
     
      for you.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Developers who are proficient in other game engines and are interested in understanding the principles of the Unreal AI framework will also benefit from this book; however, a basic knowledge of Unreal Engine and C++ is
    
    
     
      strongly recommended.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     A passion for gameplay logic will help you get the most out of
    
    
     
      this book.

     As this book is focused on AI programming and not on graphics, you won’t need a high-spec computer to follow all the chapters.
    
    
     However, to properly run Unreal Engine, a good PC with a good graphics card is
    
    
     
      highly recommended.
