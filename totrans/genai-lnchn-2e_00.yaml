    been patient throughout and always ready when advice was needed. This book also
    wouldn’t be what it is without the people at Packt, especially Tanya, our editor,
    who offered sparks of insight and encouraging words whenever needed. Finally,
    the reviewers were very helpful and generous with their critiques, making sure
    we didn’t miss anything. Any errors or oversights that remain are entirely mine.
