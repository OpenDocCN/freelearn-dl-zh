- en: Developing **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**) for game characters in Unity
    has never been easier. Unity provides game and app developers with a variety of
    tools to implement AI, from basic techniques to cutting-edge machine learning-powered
    agents. Leveraging these tools via Unity's API or built-in features allows limitless
    possibilities when it comes to creating game worlds and characters.

- en: This updated fifth edition of *Unity Artificial Intelligence Programming* starts
    by breaking down AI into simple concepts. Using a variety of examples, the book
    then takes those concepts and walks you through actual implementations designed
    to highlight key concepts and features related to game AI in Unity. As you progress,
    you'll learn how to implement a **Finite State Machine** (**FSM**) to determine
    how your AI behaves, apply probability and randomness to make games less predictable,
    and implement a basic sensory system. Later, you'll understand how to set up a
    game map with a navigation mesh, incorporate movement through techniques such
    as A* pathfinding, and provide characters with decision-making abilities using
    behavior trees.

    all the concepts and practical lessons you've learned to build an impressive vehicle
    battle game.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17984_01_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introduction to AI*,
    talks about what AI is and how it is used in games. We also discuss the various
    techniques used to implement AI in games.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17984_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100), *Finite State Machines*,
    discusses a way of simplifying how we manage the decisions that AI needs to make.
    We use FSMs to determine how AI behaves in a particular state and how it transitions
    to other states.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17984_03_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor222), *Randomness and Probability*,
    discusses the basics behind probability, and how to change the probability of
    a particular outcome. Then we look at how to add randomness to our game to make
    the AI less predictable.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17984_04_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor270), *Implementing Sensors*,
    looks at making our characters aware of the world around them. With the ability
    for our characters to see and hear, they will know when an enemy is nearby and
    when to attack.'

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17984_05_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor332), *Flocking*, discusses
    the situation where many objects travel together as a group. We will look at two
    different ways to implement flocking, and how it can be used to make objects move
    together.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B17984_06_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor375), *Path-Following and Steering
    Behaviors*, looks at how AI characters can follow a path provided to reach a destination.
    Then we look at how AI characters can find a target without having a predefined
    path, simply by moving toward a goal while avoiding obstacles as they appear.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B17984_07_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor398), *A* Pathfinding*, discusses
    a popular algorithm used to find the best route from a given location to a target
    location. With A*, we scan the terrain and find the best path that leads us to
    the goal.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B17984_08_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor447), *Navigation Mesh*, discusses
    using the power of Unity to make pathfinding easier to implement. By creating
    a Navigation Mesh (this requires Unity Pro), we will be able to represent the
    scene around us in a better way than we could by using tiles and the A* algorithm.'

- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B17984_09_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor487), *Behavior Trees*, teaches
    you about behavior trees, a popular decision-making technique for game AI. We
    will explore the general architecture of behavior trees and how to use them to
    control a simple agent. Then we will use the free plugin *Behavior Bricks* to
    apply our new knowledge to a simple mini-game project.'

    Generation*, explores the basics of generative AI and procedural content generation.
    We will see how to use Perlin noise to generate realistic terrain, and how to
    use Cellular Automata to generate a cave-like dungeon map.'

    Unity*, explores how to apply machine learning (in particular, reinforcement learning)
    to game characters for games or simulations. We will use the official Unity ML-Agents
    Toolkit. In the first part, we will learn how to configure Unity and the external
    requirements for the toolkit. Then we will showcase two simple practical examples.'

    it all together into one last project. Here, you will apply the remaining AI elements
    you have learned and create an impressive vehicle battle game.'
