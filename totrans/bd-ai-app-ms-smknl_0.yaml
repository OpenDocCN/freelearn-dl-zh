- en: Artificial intelligence is experiencing unprecedented growth, with new models
    emerging daily. With over 20 years in the technology sector, I can attest that
    the pace of innovation has never been this fast. This brings not only opportunities
    but also considerable change. Navigating these changes can be challenging and
    costly, as you may invest a lot of time learning a new technology that might become
    obsolete.

- en: Enter Microsoft Semantic Kernel – a framework that reduces these risks by enabling
    access to various AI services through popular programming languages. This framework
    spares you the details of grappling with constantly evolving APIs. By learning
    Microsoft Semantic Kernel, you can write code at the framework level, and the
    framework will call the underlying models for you. This allows you to focus on
    core concepts instead of the details of each model.

- en: One of the key benefits of Semantic Kernel is its ability to use different AI
    services. For example, code initially targeting the OpenAI GPT platform can be
    switched to Google Gemini, often without any modifications. This flexibility makes
    it easier to integrate AI into applications and to make minimal modifications
    to them when change inevitably happens.

- en: Moreover, Semantic Kernel makes AI accessible to enterprise programming languages.
    While Python has long dominated the AI landscape, many enterprise applications
    rely on C# or Java. Recognizing this, Semantic Kernel not only supports Python
    but also elevates C# to a first-class AI language. Java support is currently in
    its beta stages and is expected to launch fully in 2024.

    teaches you how to add functionality to Semantic Kernel, by adding **native functions**
    and **semantic functions** that can later be reused by you, as a developer, or
    your user to achieve their goals.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B21826_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086), *Performing Complex Actions
    by Chaining Functions*, shows you how to use several functions of a kernel in

    explores how Semantic Kernel can receive a request in natural language and automatically
    decide which functions to call to achieve an objective, allowing users of your
    application to perform functions that you did not have to write code for.'
