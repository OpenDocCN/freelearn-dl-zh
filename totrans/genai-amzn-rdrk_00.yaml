    leveraging Amazon Bedrock. We begin by exploring the suite of foundation models
    offered by Amazon Bedrock, providing insights into their capabilities and optimal
    use cases. The book then progresses to advanced techniques in prompt engineering,
    a critical skill for maximizing the potential of large language models. We explore
    strategies for model customization, allowing users to tailor these tools to their
    specific needs and domains. We also examine the implementation of **RAG**, a cutting-edge
    approach that significantly enhances model performance by integrating external
    knowledge sources.
