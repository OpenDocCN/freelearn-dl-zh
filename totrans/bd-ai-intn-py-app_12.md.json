We are being lied to. We are told that technology takes our jobs, reduces our wages, increases inequality, threatens our health, ruins the environment, degrades our society, corrupts our children, impairs our humanity, threatens our future, and is ever on the verge of ruining everything.\nWe are told to be angry, bitter, and resentful about technology. We are told to be pessimistic. The myth of Prometheus â€“ in various updated forms like Frankenstein, Oppenheimer, and Terminator â€“ haunts our nightmares. We are told to denounce our birthright â€“ our intelligence, our control over nature, our ability to build a better world. We are told to be miserable about the future.\" â€“Marc Andreessen\n```", "```py\nWe are told that artificial intelligence is a threat, that it steals our jobs, that it widens the chasm of inequality, that it's an invisible force eroding our humanity. We are told that AI is an uncontrollable beast, ready to plunge us into dystopia.\nOpenAI is here to shatter these myths.\nFounded on the principle of advancing digital intelligence for the collective good, OpenAI isn't just another tech company. It's a bold proclamation that the future is ours to shape. OpenAI stands as a beacon against the darkness of misinformation and fearmongering. It's a rallying cry for innovation, for the relentless pursuit of better.\nImagine a world where AI enhances every aspect of our livesâ€”where it amplifies human potential rather than diminishes it. OpenAI's groundbreaking models, like GPT-4, are not instruments of destruction but tools of empowerment. From revolutionizing healthcare to transforming education, from pioneering new frontiers in entertainment to optimizing complex financial systems, OpenAI's innovations are the keystones of a new era.\nOpenAI is driven by visionaries who refuse to bow to the pessimism that pervades our discourse. That we are a testament to what can be achieved when we refuse to accept the status quo. We are the architects of tomorrow, wielding AI not as a weapon, but as a bridge.\n```", "```py\nAn image of a kitten, in anime style, large eyes, chikai, chibi-style, pixel-style, anime illustration, cute, in the style of Akira Toriyama.\n```", "```py\n\"What's the average revenue?\"\n```", "```py\n\"What's the average revenue for [May 2024] for [sales sku 123]?\"\n```"]
