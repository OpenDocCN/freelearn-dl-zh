<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to leverage ChatGPT for coding activities and use it as an assistant to improve your coding productivity.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-77">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">You can access the complete code for this chapter in the book’s accompanying GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-GenAI-with-ChatGPT-Second-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-GenAI-with-ChatGPT-Second-Edition</a>.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p class="normal">While this chapter explores how ChatGPT can generate and work with code, I want to emphasize that a deep technical background is not required to appreciate its potential. Rather than focusing solely on the mechanics of coding, I encourage you to consider the broader implications of how Generative AI can bridge the gap between software developers and those without coding expertise.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-78">Why should developers use ChatGPT?</h1>
<p class="normal">Personally, I believe<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> that one of the most mind-blowing capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> of ChatGPT is in dealing with code – of any type. We’ve already seen, in previous chapters, some examples of ChatGPT generating Python code. However, ChatGPT’s capabilities for developers go way beyond that example. It can be a daily assistant for code generation, explanation, and debugging.</p>
<p class="normal">Whether you are a backend/frontend developer, a data scientist, or a data engineer, whenever you work with a programming language, ChatGPT can be a game-changer; we will see how in the several examples in the next sections.</p>
<p class="normal">From the next section onward, we will dive deeper into concrete examples of what ChatGPT can achieve when working with code. We will see end-to-end use cases covering different domains so that we can get familiar with using ChatGPT as a code assistant.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-79">Generating, optimizing, and debugging code</h1>
<p class="normal">The primary<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> capability <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>you should leverage is ChatGPT code<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> generation. How many times have you looked for a pre-built piece of code to start from? Or looked for code that could generate functions, sample datasets, SQL schemas, and so on? ChatGPT is able to generate code based on input in natural language:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.1: Example of ChatGPT generating a Python function to write into CSV files</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, not <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>only was ChatGPT able to generate the function but it was also<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> able<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> to explain what the function does, how to use it, and what to substitute in generic placeholders such as <code class="inlineCode">my_folder</code>.</p>
<p class="normal">Now let’s raise the difficulty bar. If ChatGPT is capable of generating a Python function, could it generate an entire video game as well? Let’s try. What I want to do is provide ChatGPT with an illustration of the type of game I want to develop and ask it to replicate it with code. The following is an illustration of my desired game (can you guess the name?):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="How Pac-Man Revolutionized Gaming | The MIT Press Reader" src="img/B31559_05_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.2: Illustration of the game Pac-Man</p>
<p class="normal">Now let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>ask<a id="_idIndexMarker232"/> ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> to reproduce it:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.3: Example of ChatGPT generating HTML, CSS, and JS code</p>
<p class="normal">As can be seen <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>by <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>ChatGPT’s <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>disclaimer, the full game requires a lot of code; however, let’s see how the generated code works so far (to run the code, I used the online tool <em class="italic">codepen.io</em>):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a video game  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.4: Pac-Man game generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, the draft product already looks similar to what I’m aiming for! This is an example of how Generative AI can help you overcome the <em class="italic">difficulties</em> of starting from scratch; in fact, starting from a blank page can sometimes be blocking, while having a draft product to start from can not only speed up the overall process but also stimulate creativity and improve the quality of the result.</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can also be a great assistant for code optimization. In fact, it might save us some running time or compute power by optimizing scripts that we have input. This capability might be compared, in the domain of natural language, to the writing assistance feature we saw in <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em> in the <em class="italic">Improving writing skills and translation</em> section.</p>
<p class="normal">For example, imagine <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>you<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> want to create a list of odd numbers<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> starting from another list. To achieve the result, you write the following Python script (for the purpose of this exercise, I will also track the execution time with the <code class="inlineCode">timeit</code> and <code class="inlineCode">datetime</code> libraries):</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">from timeit import default_timer as timer
from datetime import timedelta
start = timer()
elements = list(range(1_000_000)) data = []
for el in elements: if not el % 2: # if even number
data.append(el)
end = timer() print(timedelta(seconds=end-start))
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Let’s see how long it takes to run:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screen shot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.5: Speed of execution of a Python function</p>
<p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> execution<a id="_idIndexMarker241"/> time <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>was <code class="inlineCode">00.115022</code> seconds. What happens if we ask ChatGPT to optimize this script?</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.6: ChatGPT generating optimized alternatives to a Python script</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT provided me with two examples to achieve the same results with lower execution time.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s test both of them in a Jupyter notebook:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screen shot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.7: Speed of execution of two alternative functions generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, both methods lead to a great reduction in time of 44.30% and 20.68%, respectively.</p>
<p class="normal">On top of <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>code<a id="_idIndexMarker244"/> generation and optimization, ChatGPT can also be<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> leveraged for <em class="italic">error </em>explanation and debugging. Sometimes, errors are difficult to interpret; hence, a natural language explanation can be useful for identifying the problem and driving you toward the solution.</p>
<p class="normal">For example, while running a <code class="inlineCode">.py</code> file from my command line, I get the following error:</p>
<pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">File "C:\Users\vaalt\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\streamlit\elements\text_widgets.py", line 266, in _text_input text_input_proto.value = widget_state.value
TypeError: [] has type list, but expected one of: bytes, Unicode
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Let’s see whether ChatGPT is able to let me understand the nature of the error. To do so, I simply provide ChatGPT with the text of the error and ask it to give me an explanation:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.8: ChatGPT explaining a Python error in natural language</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>imagine I<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> wrote a function in Python that<a id="_idIndexMarker248"/> takes a string as input and returns the same string with an underscore after each letter.</p>
<p class="normal">In the preceding example, I was expecting to see the <code class="inlineCode">g_p_t_</code> result; however, it only returned <code class="inlineCode">t_</code> with this code:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screen shot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.9: Bugged Python function</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s ask<a id="_idIndexMarker249"/> ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> debug this function for us:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Screens screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.10: Example of ChatGPT debugging a Python function</p>
<p class="normal">Impressive, isn’t it? Again, ChatGPT <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>provided <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>the correct version of the code, and it <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>helped in explaining where the bugs were and why they led to an incorrect result. Let’s see whether it works now:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screen shot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.11: Python function after ChatGPT debugging</p>
<p class="normal">Well, it obviously does!</p>
<p class="normal">These and many other code-related functionalities could really boost your productivity, shortening the time<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker256"/> perform <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>many tasks.</p>
<p class="normal">However, ChatGPT goes beyond pure debugging. Thanks to the incredible language understanding of the GPT model, this Generative AI tool is able to generate proper documentation alongside the code, as well as explain exactly what a string of code will do, which we will see in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-80">Generating documentation and code explainability</h1>
<p class="normal">Whenever you’re working with new applications or projects, it is always good practice to correlate your <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>code <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>with documentation. It might be in the form of a docstring that you can embed in your functions or classes so that others can invoke them directly in the development environment.</p>
<p class="normal">For example, let’s consider the same function developed in the previous section and make it a Python class:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">class UnderscoreAdder:
def __init__(self, word):
    self.word = word
def add_underscores(self):
    return "_".join(self.word)  # More efficient
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">We can test it as follows:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screen shot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.12: Testing the UnderscoreAdder class</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s say I want to be able to retrieve the docstring documentation using the <code class="inlineCode">UnderscoreAdder?</code> convention. By <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>doing so with Python packages, functions, and <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>methods, we have full documentation of the capabilities of that specific object, as follows (an example with the <code class="inlineCode">pandas</code> Python library):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.13: Example of the pandas library documentation</p>
<p class="normal">So, let’s now ask<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> to produce the same result for our <code class="inlineCode">UnderscoreAdder</code> class.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.14: ChatGPT updating the code with documentation</p>
<p class="normal">As a result, if we update <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>our <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>class as shown in the preceding code with <code class="inlineCode">UnderscoreAdder?</code>, we will get the following output:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.15: The new UnderscoreAdder class documentation</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, ChatGPT can also<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> be<a id="_idIndexMarker267"/> leveraged to explain what a script, function, class, or other similar thing does in natural language. We have already seen many examples of ChatGPT enriching its code-related response with clear explanations. However, we can boost this capability by asking specific questions in terms of code understanding.</p>
<p class="normal">For example, let’s ask ChatGPT to explain to us what the following Python script does:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.16: Example of ChatGPT explaining a Python script</p>
<p class="normal">Code explainability can also be part of the preceding mentioned documentation, or it can be used among developers who might want to better understand complex code from other teams or (as sometimes happens to me) remember what they wrote some time ago.</p>
<p class="normal">Thanks to ChatGPT and the capabilities mentioned in this section, developers can easily keep track of the project<a id="_idIndexMarker268"/> life <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>cycle in natural language so that it is easier for both new team members and non-technical users to understand the work done so far.</p>
<p class="normal">We will see in the next section how code explainability is a pivotal step for ML model interpretability in data science projects.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-81">Understanding ML model interpretability</h1>
<p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Model interpretability</strong> refers to<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> the degree of ease with which a human can comprehend the logic behind the ML model’s predictions. Essentially, it is the capability to comprehend how a model arrives at its decisions and which variables are contributing to its forecasts.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see an example of model interpretability using a deep learning <strong class="keyWord">convolutional neural network</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CNN</strong>) for image<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> classification. I built my model in Python using Keras. For this purpose, I will download the CIFAR-10 dataset directly from <code class="inlineCode">keras.datasets</code>; it consists of 60,000 32x32 color images (so 3-channel images) in 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck), with 6,000 images per class. Here, I will share just the body of the model; you can find all the related code in the book’s GitHub repository for data preparation and pre-processing at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Generative-AI-with-ChatGPT-and-OpenAI-Models/tree/main/Chapter%206%20-%20ChatGPT%20for%20Developers/code">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Generative-AI-with-ChatGPT-and-OpenAI-Models/tree/main/Chapter%206%20-%20ChatGPT%20for%20Developers/code</a></p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">model=tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32,kernel_ size=(3,3),activation='relu',input_shape=
(32,32,1)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten()) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024,activation='relu')) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10,activation='softmax'))
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The preceding code is<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> made of several layers that perform different actions. I might be interested in getting an explanation of the structure of the model as well as the purpose of each layer. Let’s ask ChatGPT for some help with that (below you can see an extract of the response):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.17: Model interpretability with ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see in the preceding figure, ChatGPT was able to give us a clear explanation of the structure and layers of our CNN. It also adds some comments and tips, such as the fact that using the max pooling layer helps reduce the dimensionality of the input.</p>
<p class="normal">I can also be supported by ChatGPT in interpreting model results in the validation phase. So, after splitting the data <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>into training and test sets and training the model on the training set, I want to see its performance on the test set:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.18: Evaluation metrics</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s also ask ChatGPT to elaborate on our validation metrics (truncated output):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.19: Example of ChatGPT explaining evaluation metrics</p>
<p class="normal">Once again, the result <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>is really impressive, and it provides clear guidance on how to set up ML experiments in terms of training and test sets. It explains how important it is for the model to be sufficiently generalized so that it does not overfit and is able to predict accurate results on data that it has never seen before.</p>
<p class="normal">There are many reasons why model interpretability is important. A pivotal element is that it reduces the gap between business users and the code behind models. This is key to enabling business users to understand how a model behaves, as well as translating it into useful business ideas.</p>
<p class="normal">Furthermore, model interpretability enables one of the key principles of responsible and ethical AI, which is transparency in how the model behind AI systems thinks and behaves. Unlocking model interpretability means detecting potential biases or harmful behaviors a model could have while in production and consequently preventing them from happening.</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, ChatGPT can provide valuable support in the context of model interpretability, generating insights at the row level, as we saw in the previous example.</p>
<p class="normal">The next and last ChatGPT capability we will explore will be yet another boost for developers’ productivity, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>when various programming languages are being used within the same project.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-82">Translation among different programming languages</h1>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, we saw how ChatGPT has great capabilities for translating between different languages. What is <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>really incredible is that natural language is not its only object of translation. In fact, ChatGPT is capable of translating between different programming languages while keeping the same output and style (namely, it preserves docstring documentation if present).</p>
<p class="normal">There are so many scenarios where this could be a game-changer.</p>
<p class="normal">For example, you might have to learn a new programming language or statistical tool you’ve never seen before because you need to quickly deliver a project on it. With the help of ChatGPT, you can start programming in your language of preference and then ask it to translate to the desired language, which you will be learning alongside the translation process.</p>
<p class="normal">Imagine that the project needs to be delivered in MATLAB (a proprietary numerical computing and programming software developed by MathWorks), yet you’ve always programmed in Python. The project consists of <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>classifying images from the <strong class="keyWord">Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MNIST</strong>) dataset (the original dataset description and related paper can be found at <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/</a>). The dataset contains numerous handwritten digits and is frequently utilized to teach various image-processing systems.</p>
<p class="normal">To start, I wrote the following Python code to initialize a deep learning model for classification:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">from tensorflow.keras import layers
# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_ data()
# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28) / 255.0 x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28) / 255.0 y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train) y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test)
# Define the model architecture model = keras.Sequential([
layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(28*28,)), layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2, epochs=10, batch_size=128)
# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0) print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Let’s now see what <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>happens if we give the preceding code as context to ChatGPT and ask it to translate it into MATLAB:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_05_20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.20: ChatGPT translates Python code into MATLAB</p>
<p class="normal">Code translation could also reduce the skill gap between new technologies and current programming capabilities.</p>
<p class="normal">Another key implication of code <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>translation is <strong class="keyWord">application modernization</strong>. Indeed, imagine you want to refresh your application stack, namely, migrating to the cloud. You could decide<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> to initiate with a simple lift and shift going toward <strong class="keyWord">infrastructure-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IaaS</strong>) instances (such as Windows or<a id="_idIndexMarker281"/> Linux <strong class="keyWord">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">VMs</strong>)). However, in the second phase, you might want to refactor, rearchitect, or even rebuild your applications.</p>
<p class="normal">The following diagram<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> depicts the various options for application modernization:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.21: Four ways you can migrate your applications to the public cloud</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT and OpenAI Codex models can help you with the migration. Consider mainframes, for example.</p>
<p class="normal">Mainframes are computers that are predominantly employed by large organizations to carry out essential tasks such as bulk data processing for activities such as censuses, consumer and industry statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. The application programming language of the mainframe environment is <strong class="keyWord">Common Business Oriented Language</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">COBOL</strong>). Despite<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> being invented in 1959, COBOL is still in use today and is one of the oldest programming languages in existence.</p>
<p class="normal">As technology continues to improve, applications residing in the realm of mainframes have been subject to a continuous process of migration and modernization aimed at enhancing existing legacy mainframe infrastructure in areas such as interface, code, cost, performance, and maintainability.</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, this implies translating COBOL to more modern programming languages, such as C# or Java. The problem is that COBOL is unknown to most new-generation programmers; hence, there is a huge skills gap in this context.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s consider a COBOL script that reads an input number, adds 10 to it, and then prints the result:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. AddTen.
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  INPUT-NUMBER    PIC 9(5).
       01  RESULT-NUMBER   PIC 9(5).
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY 'Enter a number: '.
           ACCEPT INPUT-NUMBER.
           COMPUTE RESULT-NUMBER = INPUT-NUMBER + 10.
           DISPLAY 'Result after adding 10: ' RESULT-NUMBER.
           STOP RUN.
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">I then passed the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/> COBOL script to ChatGPT so that it could use it as context to formulate its response. Let’s now ask ChatGPT to translate that script into C#:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_22.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.22: Example of ChatGPT translating COBOL to C#</p>
<p class="normal">Tools such as ChatGPT can help reduce the skill gap in this and similar scenarios by introducing a layer<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> that knows both the past and future of programming.</p>
<p class="normal">In conclusion, ChatGPT can be an effective tool for application modernization, providing code upgrading in addition to valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing legacy systems. With its advanced language-processing capabilities and extensive knowledge base, ChatGPT can help organizations streamline their modernization efforts, making the process faster, more efficient, and <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>more effective.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-83">Working with code on canvas</h1>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, we mentioned the new ChatGPT canvas feature, which allows users to dynamically <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>modify <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>the model’s response in a collaborative workspace. However, when it comes to code development, this feature really shines.</p>
<p class="normal">In fact, it provides an environment for code development, execution, and debugging.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see an example. We will start with a simple query to ChatGPT:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_23.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.23: Generating code with ChatGPT</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.25: Seamlessly testing and modifying code</p>
<p class="normal">This is a game-changer for software development; it means having the possibility to seamlessly test and execute code while interacting with ChatGPT, without the need to move from this app to your development environment.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s go even further. Another way you to interact with canvas is by invoking it as a tool:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.26: Invoking canvas directly</p>
<p class="normal">By doing so, ChatGPT will automatically <em class="italic">enter in the mood</em> of working with code. Let’s ask the same question as <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>before, but<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> this time, leveraging the canvas tool directly.</p>
<p class="normal">In this case, ChatGPT will directly open a canvas workspace for us, providing additional coding tools:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_05_27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.27: The canvas workspace</p>
<p class="normal">With these tools, you have four main features:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Add comments</strong> feature gives instructions to ChatGPT to modify your code in the same canvas you are working on</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Add logs</strong> feature inserts print statements or logging mechanisms into your code, aiding in tracking execution flow and diagnosing issues</li>
<li class="bulletList">By selecting the <strong class="screenText">Fix bugs</strong> shortcut, ChatGPT analyzes your code to identify and correct errors, enhancing code reliability</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Port to a language</strong> feature translates your code into another programming language seamlessly</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>these <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>features, ChatGPT’s canvas offers a comprehensive environment for code development, execution, and debugging, enhancing productivity and facilitating a smoother coding workflow.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-84">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for developers looking to enhance their skills and streamline their workflows. We started by seeing how ChatGPT can generate, optimize, and debug your code, but we also covered further capabilities, such as generating documentation alongside your code, explaining your ML models, and translating between different programming languages for application modernization.</p>
<p class="normal">Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, ChatGPT offers a powerful tool for learning and growth, reducing the gap between code and natural language.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into another domain of application where ChatGPT <em class="italic">could</em> be a game-changer: marketing.</p>
