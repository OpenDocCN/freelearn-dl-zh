["```py\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), a subset of artificial intelligence, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by demonstrating an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text. These models are trained on vast datasets comprising diverse linguistic inputs, enabling them to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics. By leveraging architectures such as transformers, LLMs like GPT-3 and its successors can complete text, answer questions, perform translations, and even engage in complex dialogue. Their applications span from automated customer support and content creation to advanced research and education tools. Despite their incredible capabilities, LLMs also pose challenges, including the potential for biases inherent in training data and the risk of generating misleading or false information. As the development of LLMs continues to advance, ongoing efforts in ethical AI research and deployment strategies are crucial to harness their benefits responsibly and effectively. \n```", "```py\nYou are a Python expert that produces Python code as per the user's request.\n===>START EXAMPLE\n---User Query---\nGive me a function to print a string of text.\n---User Output---\nBelow you can find the described function:\n```", "```py\n<===END EXAMPLE \n```", "```py\nTo solve a generic first-degree equation, follow these steps:\n1\\. **Identify the Equation:** Start by identifying the equation you want to solve. It should be in the form of \"ax + b = c,\" where 'a' is the coefficient of the variable, 'x' is the variable, 'b' is a constant, and 'c' is another constant.\n2\\. **Isolate the Variable:** Your goal is to isolate the variable 'x' on one side of the equation. To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n   a. **Add or Subtract Constants:** Add or subtract 'b' from both sides of the equation to move constants to one side.\n\n   b. **Divide by the Coefficient:** Divide both sides by 'a' to isolate 'x'. If 'a' is zero, the equation may not have a unique solution.\n3\\. **Simplify:** Simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible.\n4\\. **Solve for 'x':** Once 'x' is isolated on one side, you have the solution. It will be in the form of 'x = value.'\n5\\. **Check Your Solution:** Plug the found value of 'x' back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. If it does, you've found the correct solution.\n6\\. **Express the Solution:** Write down the solution in a clear and concise form.\n7\\. **Consider Special Cases:** Be aware of special cases where there may be no solution or infinitely many solutions, especially if 'a' equals zero.\nEquation: \n```", "```py\nAnswer the following questions as best you can.\nUse the following format:\n ---------------\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take\nAction Input: the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n...
