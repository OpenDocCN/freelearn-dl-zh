<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">As we saw in the previous chapters, LLMs set the basis for extremely powerful applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Starting with LLMs, over the last months we have witnessed an explosive advancement in generative models, from multimodality to newly born frameworks, to enable multi-agent applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">In the next sections, we will see some examples of these new releases.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-178"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">GPT-4V(ision)</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">GPT-4V(ision) is a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">large multimodal model</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">LMM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">) developed by OpenAI</span><a id="_idIndexMarker922"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> and officially released</span><a id="_idIndexMarker923"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> in September 2023. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">It enables users to instruct GPT-4 to analyze image inputs provided by the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">This integration of image analysis into LLMs represents a significant advancement in AI research and development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">Model multimodality was achieved by using a technique called </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">image tokenization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">, which converts images into sequences</span><a id="_idIndexMarker924"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"> of tokens that can be processed by the same model as text. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">This allows the model to handle different types of data, such as text and images, and generate outputs that are consistent and coherent across modalities.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Since its initial trials in April 2023, GPT-4V has shown remarkable abilities in various domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Moreover, many businesses have begun to integrate this model in their early testing stages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">One of the successful examples is Be My Eyes, an app that assists the population of more than 250 million people who have visual impairments or blindness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">The app links people who have low vision or blindness with helpers who can assist them with everyday activities, such as recognizing a product or finding their way around an airport. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.5">Using the new visual input feature of GPT-4, Be My Eyes created a Virtual Volunteer™ in its app that uses GPT-4. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.6">This Virtual Volunteer can produce the same amount of context and comprehension as a human volunteer.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">The GPT-4 technology can do more than just identify and label what’s in a picture; it can also infer and examine the situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">For instance, it can look at the items in a fridge and recommend what you can cook with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">What sets GPT-4 apart from other language and machine learning models is its capability to engage in dialogue and the higher level of analytical skill that the technology provides. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">Simple image recognition applications only identify what you see. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">They can’t converse to find out if the noodles are made with the proper ingredients or if the thing on the floor is not just a ball but also liable to trip you up—and tell you that.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">In response to early experimentation on GPT-4V before it went public, OpenAI has implemented several mitigations to address risks and biases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">These mitigations are aimed at improving a model’s safety and reducing the potential harm caused by its output:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Refusal system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">: OpenAI has added refusals for certain types of obviously harmful generations in GPT-4V. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">This system helps prevent a model from generating content that promotes hate groups or contains hate symbols.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Evaluation and red teaming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">: OpenAI has performed assessments and consulted with external experts to examine the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-4V. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">This process helps detect potential flaws and risks in a model’s output. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">The assessments cover areas such as scientific competence, medical guidance, stereotyping, disinformation threats, hateful content, and visual vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Scientific competence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">: Red teamers evaluated GPT-4V’s abilities and challenges in scientific domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">While the model demonstrated the skill to comprehend complex information in images and verify claims in scientific papers, it also showed challenges, such as the occasional mixing of separate text elements and the possibility of factual mistakes.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Hateful content:</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> GPT-4V declines to answer questions about hate symbols and extremist content in some cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">However, the model’s behavior may be variable, and it may not always decline to generate completions related to less-known hate groups or symbols. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">OpenAI recognizes the need for further enhancements in addressing hateful content.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Ungrounded inferences</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">: OpenAI has implemented mitigations to address risks associated with ungrounded inferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">The model now refuses requests for ungrounded inferences about people, reducing the potential for biased or inaccurate responses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">OpenAI aims to refine these mitigations to enable the model to answer questions about people in low-risk contexts in the future.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Disinformation risks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">: GPT-4V’s ability to generate text content tailored to image input poses increased risks with disinformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">OpenAI acknowledges the need for proper risk assessment and context consideration when using the model in relation to disinformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">The combination of generative image models and GPT-4V’s text generation capabilities may impact disinformation risks, but additional mitigations such as watermarking or provenance tools may be necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">These mitigations, along with the contribution from existing safety measures and ongoing research, aim to improve safety and reduce the biases in GPT-4V. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">OpenAI acknowledges the dynamic and challenging nature of addressing these risks and remains committed to refining and improving a model’s performance in future iterations.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Overall, the GPT-4V has unveiled</span><a id="_idIndexMarker925"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> extraordinary capabilities and paves the way for multimodality within LLM-powered applications.</span></p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-180"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">AutoGen</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">In October 2023, Microsoft released</span><a id="_idIndexMarker927"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> a new open-source project called AutoGen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">It is a Python lightweight framework that allows multiple LLM-powered agents to cooperate with each other to solve users’ tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">For an overview of what the cooperation frameworks look like, you can refer to </span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main"><span class="url"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main</span></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Earlier in Part 2 of this book, we covered many scenarios of LangChain Agents leveraging external tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">In those scenarios, we had one agent powered by an LLM that dynamically decided which tool to use to solve a user’s query. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">AutoGen works differently, in the sense that it lets different agents, each one acting with a specific role and expertise, cooperate to address the user’s query. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">The main element of novelty here is that each agent can actually generate output that serves as input to other agents, as well as generate and modify the plan to be executed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">That is the reason why the framework has also been designed to keep a human or admin in the loop, to actually approve or discard actions and executions.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">According to the original paper </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> by </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Wu et al.</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">, there are three main reasons</span><a id="_idIndexMarker928"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> why the multi-agent conversation exhibits great performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Feedback incorporation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">: Since LLMs have the capacity to elaborate and leverage feedback, they can cooperate through conversations in natural language with each other, and humans as well, to adjust the way they solve a given problem.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Adaptability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">: Since LLMs are general-purpose models that can adapt to different tasks if properly configured, we can initialize different agents that leverage the various capabilities of LLMs in a modular and complementary way.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Splitting complex tasks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">: LLMs work better when they split complex tasks into smaller subtasks (as covered in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> about prompt engineering techniques). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Henceforth, multi-agent conversations can enhance this partition, delegating each agent to a subtask, while keeping the overall picture of the problem to solve.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">To enable a multi-agent conversation, there are two main components</span><a id="_idIndexMarker929"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> to be aware of:</span></p>
