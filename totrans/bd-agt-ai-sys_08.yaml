    the AI’s outputs and have confidence in its decision-making process. Without this
    transparency and explainability, users may perceive the AI as a black box, making
    it difficult to trust its recommendations or outputs fully. Transparency in AI
    operates on two levels: the **algorithmic level** and the **presentation level**
    . Algorithmic transparency involves openness about the model’s architecture, training
    data, and potential biases, ensuring that developers and regulators can assess
    its reliability and fairness. Presentation transparency, or explainability, focuses
    on how the AI communicates its reasoning to users, helping them understand why
    a specific decision or recommendation was made. Both aspects are essential for
    trust – without algorithmic transparency, stakeholders may question the system’s
    integrity, while a lack of explainability can leave users feeling uncertain about
    its outputs. A well-balanced approach strengthens confidence in AI-driven decisions.'

    the model. The embeddings for the tokens are retrieved and tracked for gradients,
    allowing the saliency scores to be computed, indicating how much each token contributes
    to the model’s prediction. A custom forward function is used to feed the embeddings
    into the model, and the saliency attribute method calculates the saliency scores.
    These scores are then aggregated across token embeddings, and the tokens are converted
    back to their readable form. Finally, a bar chart is generated to visually display
    the importance of each token, providing insights into which tokens had the most

    personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and historical data.
    Uncertainty can arise from ambiguous or vague user inputs, incomplete or outdated
    travel information in the training data, or unforeseen events such as weather
    disruptions or local conflicts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To handle uncertainty, developers could consider probabilistic modeling, Bayesian
    inference, and uncertainty quantification approaches in generative AI systems.
    These techniques allow the models to yield probabilities or confidence intervals
    instead of deterministic outputs, update beliefs as new data arrives, and estimate
    uncertainties associated with their predictions.

    including the training data, algorithmic design, or societal biases. These biases
    can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, perpetuating historical inequities
    and undermining trust in the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the travel agent scenario, biases could arise if the training data predominantly
    features travel experiences catered to specific demographic groups, income levels,
    or cultural perspectives. As a result, the AI system’s recommendations might inadvertently
    exclude or underrepresent certain communities, travel preferences, or destinations.
