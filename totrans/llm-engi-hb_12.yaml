- en: Building robust and scalable ML systems requires more than creating powerful
    models. It demands an all-encompassing approach to operationalizing the entire
    ML lifecycle. Let’s explore the **six core principles** that guide the MLOps field.
    These principles are independent of any tool and are at the core of building robust
    and scalable ML systems. They provide a guideline for designing production-ready
    applications, ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability at every stage.

- en: '**Manual process**: The process is experimental and iterative in the early
    stages of developing an ML application. The data scientist manually performs each
    pipeline step, such as data preparation and validation, model training, and testing.
    At this point, they commonly use Jupyter notebooks to train their models. This
    stage’s output is the code used to prepare the data and train the models.'

- en: '**Continuous** **training** (**CT**): The next level involves automating model
    training. This is known as continuous training, which triggers model retraining
    whenever required. At this point, you often automate your data and model validation
    steps. This step is usually done by an orchestration tool, such as ZenML, that
    glues all your code together and runs it on specific triggers. The most common
    triggers are on a schedule, for example, every day or when a specific event comes
    in, such as when new data is uploaded or the monitoring system detects a drop
    in performance, offering you the flexibility to adapt to various triggers.'

- en: '**CI/CD**: In the final stage, you implement your CI/CD pipelines to enable
    fast and reliable deployment of your ML code into production. The key advancement
    at this stage is the automatic building, testing, and deployment of data, ML models,
    and training pipeline components. CI/CD is used to quickly push new code into

    architecture, we can quickly move from a manual process to CI/CD/CT. In *Figure
    A.1*, we can observe that the CT process can be triggered by various events, such
    as a drop in performance detected by the monitoring pipeline or a batch of fresh
    data arriving. Also, *Figure A.1* is split into two main sections; the first one
    highlights the automated processes, while at the bottom, we can observe the manual
    processes performed by the data science team while experimenting with various
    data processing methods and models. Once they improve the model by tinkering with
    how the data is processed or the model architecture, they push the code to the
    code repository, which triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, package, and
    deploy the new changes to the FTI pipelines.

  id: totrans-14

    of the code) on every change added to the codebase. Also, Git-based tools usually
    allow us to make releases, which typically pack multiple features and bug fixes.
    While the commits contain unique identifiers that are not human-interpretable,
    a release follows more common conventions based on their major, minor, and patch
    versions. For example, in a release with version “v1.2.3,” 1 is the major version,
    2 is the minor version, and 3 is the patch version. Popular tools are GitHub and
    GitLab.

    version all the models used within your system. It usually follows the same versioning
    conventions used in code releases, defined as **Semantic Versioning**, which,
    along with the major, minor, and patch versions, also supports alpha and beta
    releases that signal applications. At this point, you can also leverage the ML
    metadata store to attach information to the stored model, such as what data it
    was trained on, its architecture, performance, latency, and whatever else makes
    sense to your specific use case. Doing so creates a clear catalog of models that
    can easily be navigated across your team and company.

- en: Versioning the **data** isn’t as straightforward as versioning the code and
    model because it depends on the type of data you have (structured or unstructured)
    and the scale of data you have (big or small). For example, for structured data,
    you can leverage a SQL database with a version column that helps you track the
    changes in the dataset. However, other popular solutions are based on Git-like
    systems, such as **Data Version Control** (**DVC**), that track every change made
    to the dataset. Other trendy solutions are based on artifacts similar to a model
    registry that allows you to add a virtual layer to your dataset, tracking and
    creating a new version for every change made to your data. Comet.ml, **W&B** (**Weights
    & Biases**), and ZenML offer powerful artifact features. For all solutions, you
    must store the data on-premises or use cloud object storage solutions such as
    AWS S3\. These tools provide features that allow you to structure your datasets
    and versions, track, and access them.

    information, such as metrics and visual representations of your model predictions,
    to compare all your experiments and easily select the best model. Popular tools

    ML models, we haven’t explicitly described how they should work. We have used
    data to compile a probabilistic solution, which means that our ML model will constantly
    be exposed to a level of degradation. This happens because the data from production

    to support an unknown class or adjust the head of the model to add the new class

    Let’s assume you want to build a model that predicts whether a person will buy
    a specific car. You initially built it for the American market. Now, you want
    to use it in the European market, where people tend to buy smaller cars, creating
    a drift between the size feature of the car and the output probability of purchasing
    the vehicle. Of course, concept drifts can be more subtle than this example.

    (**KS**) test to monitor a single continuous feature. This is known as a **univariate**
    (**1D**) test. Thus, you must run it for every feature you want to monitor. You
    can leverage a chi-squared univariate test to monitor categorical variables and
    determine if the frequency of events in production is consistent with the reference
    window distribution.

    a multivariate distribution, which is how LLMs work with text. A popular approach
    is to take the embeddings of the test and reference windows, apply a dimensionality
    reduction algorithm, and apply an algorithm such as **maximum mean discrepancy**
    (**MMD**). This algorithm is a kernel-based approach that measures the distance
    between two distributions by computing the distance between the mean of the embeddings
    of the two windows.

    to find the correct values, as you don’t want to overcrowd your alarming system
    with false positives. In that case, your alarm system won’t be trustworthy, and
    you will either overreact or not react at all to issues in your system. Some common
    channels for sending alarms to your stakeholders are Slack, Discord, your email,
    and PagerDuty. The system’s stakeholders can be the core engineers, managers,
    or anyone interested in the system.

    taking any action, you should be able to inspect it and understand what caused
    it. You should inspect what metric triggered the alarm, with what value, the time
    it happened, and anything else that makes sense to your application.

    that is a costly operation. Thus, you first have to check that the data is valid,
    the schema hasn’t changed, and the data point was not an isolated outlier. If
    neither is true, you should trigger the training pipeline and train the model
    on the newly shifted dataset to solve the drift.

    produce identical results given the same input. This has two main aspects.'
  id: totrans-120
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is that you should always know what the inputs are—for example,
    when training a model, you can use a plethora of hyperparameters. Thus, you need
    a way to always track what assets were used to generate the new assets, such as
    what dataset version and config were used to train the model.
  id: totrans-121
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second aspect is based on the non-deterministic nature of ML processes.
    For example, when training a model from scratch, all the weights are initially
    randomly initialized. Thus, even if you use the same dataset and hyperparameters,
    you might end up with a model with a different performance. This aspect can be
    solved by always using a seed before generating random numbers, as in reality,
    we cannot digitally create randomness, only pseudo-random numbers. Thus, by providing
    a seed, we ensure that we always produce the same trace of pseudo-random numbers.
    This can also happen at the feature engineering step, in case we impute values
    with random values or randomly remove data or labels. But as a general rule of
    thumb, always try to make your processes as deterministic as possible, and in
    case you have to introduce randomness, always provide a seed that you have control
    over.
