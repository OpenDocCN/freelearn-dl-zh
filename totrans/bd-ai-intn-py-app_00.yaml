- en: This book is for software engineers and developers looking to build intelligent
    applications using GenAI. While suitable for beginners, a basic understanding
    of Python programming is required. Working knowledge of MongoDB and OpenAI LLMs
    is preferred but not necessary. This book provides a step-by-step approach to
    building AI applications, making it suitable for both novices and experienced
    practitioners.
