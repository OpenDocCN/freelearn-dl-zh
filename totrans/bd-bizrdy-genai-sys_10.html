    <h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Presenting Your Business-Ready Generative AI System</h1>
    <p class="normal">Creating an innovative GenAISys alone will not get us customers, funding, or possibly even recognition. In today’s fiercely competitive landscape, hundreds, if not thousands, of AI solutions, agentic systems, and similar offerings are vying simultaneously for market attention. Businesses, investors, and end users face an overwhelming flood of options—from industry giants such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, <strong class="keyWord">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AWS</strong>), and IBM to an ever-expanding array of start-ups and mid-sized companies. Where does that leave us, and what should we do?</p>
    <p class="normal">We need two things to penetrate the market’s thickening wall: <em class="italic">implementation</em> and <em class="italic">profitability</em>. In this book, up to now, we have built a proof of concept of our ability to deliver an effective GenAISys capable of supporting core business functions across the supply chain—from marketing and production to delivery and customer service. But now, we must turn our technical achievements into a compelling story to effectively communicate and sell our ideas to stakeholders—be it internal teams, employers, potential customers, or investors. To successfully present our GenAISys, we need a well-crafted demonstration scenario that highlights our existing capabilities and clearly conveys our capacity for further innovation and expansion. Deciding exactly when to pause development and transition into presenting the proof of concept is critical.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, the method described is only one of the many ways to achieve a successful presentation of a GenAISys amid relentless AI competition. We will focus on getting straight to the point. Given that the attention span of present-day AI-informed audiences is limited, capturing the attention of your audience will prove challenging. The chapter will thus focus on the first seven minutes of a presentation of our GenAISys. We will transition smoothly from the IPython-based interface developed throughout this book into a flexible, easily adaptable frontend web page. This strategy allows us to quickly customize our demonstration to address specific project requirements, supported by the credibility of our working GenAISys prototype. We will systematically present the key components: core functionality, vector store integration, essential <strong class="keyWord">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">KPIs</strong>), external database connectivity, and critical aspects of security and privacy. Additionally, we will emphasize how the system can be collaboratively customized through stakeholder workshops.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, to showcase the ultimate flexibility and future potential of our framework, we will introduce a prospective evolution of our GenAISys: a swarm-based <strong class="keyWord">multi-agent system</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MAS</strong>), demonstrating a powerful new paradigm of human-AI co-worker collaboration. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to combine the actual GenAISys features with the potential evolutions that can be added to the system.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter covers the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Designing the presentation of the GenAISys</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Building a flexible frontend web interface</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Presenting the basic GenAISys functions</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Showing the possible evolutions in terms of integration, security, and customizations</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Introducing a MAS</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by carefully designing the presentation of our GenAISys.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Designing the presentation of the GenAISys</h1>
    <p class="normal">Designing <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>the presentation for the educational GenAISys we’ve built throughout this book goes beyond the technical dimension. Whether your audience is an internal team, an investor, or a client, the success of your GenAISys will largely depend on clearly communicating its <em class="italic">business value</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">A powerful GenAISys presentation must begin with a compelling introduction, especially during the first few critical minutes, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.1: A fast-track presentation" src="img/B32304_10_1.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.1: A fast-track presentation</p>
    <p class="normal">The timing indicated (in minutes) is flexible and can be adjusted according to your needs. However, modern audiences expect concise, impactful, and effective presentations. Keep your audience engaged by clearly demonstrating expertise and efficiency. For simplicity, we’ll refer to any audience—your internal team, investors, or clients—as the <em class="italic">customer</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">The customer will <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>expect the following timeline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Minute 1 – Presenting your team and yourself</strong>: Present your team and yourself briefly. Highlight your strong points and then begin the presentation before they get bored. The length of this introduction is up to you, but don’t overdo it.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Minute 2 – Explain the use case with a convincing KPI</strong>: Make sure that the use case you present is profitable, whether it’s marketing growth, production resource optimization, reduced delivery times, better customer service to increase sales, or any other activity booster. Very briefly introduce the generative AI foundation of the project. Then, rapidly explain that the KPI can be added to the interface and displayed in real time if requested, as shown:</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.2: Real-time KPI" src="img/B32304_10_2.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.2: Real-time KPI</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Minute 3 – Begin presenting the frontend GenAISys interface</strong>: No matter how hard you work, something will always be missing. Also, the GenAISys we built requires explanations at a higher level with a PowerPoint presentation and frontend web page that we will begin preparing in the <em class="italic">Building a flexible HTML interface</em> section of this chapter. The HTML page incorporates the functionality we built in the GenAISys and takes it further with ideas that we need for the presentation and ideas the customer wants. Show that you can rapidly adapt a flexible HTML page to meet customer needs interactively in workshops, as we will see in the <em class="italic">6. Customization </em>section.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Minute 5 – Begin showing the AI functions while presenting the flexible interface</strong>: Continue the concept of working together to finalize the GenAISys interface and integration in a collaborative, human-centric AI approach. Emphasize the unique blend of next-generation technologies integrated in the GenAISys, such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Pinecone. Keep the presentation as human-centric as possible, showing that the goal is to leverage the power of the multi-user GenAISys you built to increase performance with AI as <em class="italic">copilots</em>, not replacements. Keep this in mind as much as possible to convey a collaborative spirit that will help build trust in your system. You can begin to show some of the functionalities of the educational GenAISys we built in this book. You can also show more if you went further to adapt to the use case. </li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Minute 7 – Alternate between the web interface and the GenAISys functions</strong>: Now, it’s time to show how your GenAISys can provide an efficient service by combining implementation and profitability. Navigate between the web interface and the GenAISys you built. Show your expertise with the GenAISys components. Demonstrate your flexibility and creativity with a web interface that can be rapidly adapted to meet the customer’s needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By carefully structuring <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>your presentation this way, you demonstrate clear expertise and practical flexibility. You’ve set the stage to convincingly showcase your business-ready GenAISys.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, let’s build out the flexible web interface, preparing the foundation to seamlessly guide your audience through your fully integrated and user-friendly GenAISys.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Building a flexible HTML interface</h1>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>demonstration web interface needs to be flexible and adaptable. In some cases, we might even have to adapt the code on the spot during a coffee break! A customer might insist on adding a logo, changing the font, or changing the color. If we resist, this may become a stumbling block that casts a shadow over the whole presentation! We need to walk a fine line between adaptability and stability in this new era of generative AI-aware customers. Hence, in this section, we will first build an interface with GenAISys’s core functionality, keeping flexibility in mind. You can have the web page open in your HTML editor and refresh it in real time if the customer insists on seeing a modification immediately. Remember, everybody has access to AI copilots and can overtake us in real time. We need to be faster than the competition, which could also be an end user.</p>
    <p class="normal">The goal is to show that the IPython proof-of-concept interface is independent of the underlying AI orchestration functions. Thus, it can be adapted to any environment necessary for a project. In this case, we are choosing to show what a web page on a dedicated server would look like. Let’s get started by opening <code class="inlineCode">GenAISys_Presentation.ipynb</code> within the Chapter10 directory on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/Denis2054/Building-Business-Ready-Generative-AI-Systems/tree/main">https://github.com/Denis2054/Building-Business-Ready-Generative-AI-Systems/tree/main</a>).</p>
    <p class="normal">First, we download the helper scripts and web pages required for the demonstration:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">!curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denis2054/Building-Business-Ready-Generative-AI-Systems/master/commons/grequests.py --output grequests.py
from grequests import download
download("Chapter10","01.html")
download("Chapter10","02.html")
download("Chapter10","03.html")
download("Chapter10","04.html")
download("Chapter10","05.html")
download("Chapter10","06.html")
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Then, we define a reusable Python function to conveniently load and display the HTML interface within the notebook:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">from IPython.display import HTML, display
def display_interface(filename):
    with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        html_content = file.read()
    display(HTML(html_content))
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">In <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>this section, we’ll carefully walk through the code for <code class="inlineCode">01.html</code>. The goal is to ensure you clearly understand the interface’s structure and logic. This clarity is critical for responding swiftly to potential customer requests during the presentation.</p>
    <p class="normal">The code begins with a standard <code class="inlineCode">&lt;head&gt;</code> section, which includes both metadata (such as <code class="inlineCode">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> and <code class="inlineCode">&lt;title&gt;</code>). The CSS, visual styling, is embedded inside the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;style&gt;</code> tag:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Generative AI Chat Interface&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      margin: 20px;
      background: #f4f4f4;
    }
….
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Both the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code class="inlineCode">&lt;body&gt;</code> sections are fully customizable based on the project’s specific branding and design guidelines. In this case, the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;body&gt;</code> container will wrap all the content and apply the CSS layout styling we just defined:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The header doesn’t contain the term “Generative AI System.” The choice, in this case, is to provide an accessible term that a broader audience can relate to:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;h1&gt;Generative AI Chat Interface&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>user selection block contains the three generic usernames we have been using throughout the book. It provides flexibility to adapt to any questions about who they are, depending on the project’s specifications. You can choose to provide domain-specific names depending on the context of your presentation. You could also add more users. For the moment, let’s keep it simple:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="userSelector"&gt;User:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;select id="userSelector"&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;User01&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;User02&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;User03&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The user input message area contains standard information. We can modify it to suit an industry or task. It could even vary depending on the user and be domain-specific, such as “enter the customer’s review here.” In this case, we will display the message we have been using to build our GenAISys:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="messageInput"&gt;Your Message:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;textarea id="messageInput" placeholder="Type your message here or type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation." rows="4"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">A standard send button is then implemented, but keep in mind that it can be visually customized according to specific branding requests during your presentation:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;button id="sendButton"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Let’s now add the checkbox options/widgets for the AI agent to enable voice or activate file management:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="checkbox-group"&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;
    &lt;input type="checkbox" id="agentCheckbox" checked&gt;
    Agent
  &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;
    &lt;input type="checkbox" id="voiceCheckbox"&gt;
    Voice Output
  &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;
    &lt;input type="checkbox" id="filesCheckbox"&gt;
    Files
  &lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Study the code, regardless of how it was designed, to be prepared to modify it in real time if the situation becomes tense over how something is displayed. This will show that you are flexible and <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>can easily adapt to customer needs. It can be tricky, but it might be necessary. Just make sure to modify something only if the customer insists so as to avoid taking unnecessary risks.</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Reasoning</strong> dropdown highlights the powerful reasoning capabilities within our GenAISys, as implemented throughout the previous chapters. You can readily adjust or add reasoning options to match your project specifications:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="reasoningSelector"&gt;Reasoning:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;select id="reasoningSelector"&gt;
    &lt;option value="None" selected&gt;None&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="Analysis"&gt;Analysis&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="Generation"&gt;Generation&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="Mobility"&gt;Mobility&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The model selection block contains strategic information. The customer will want to know whether the model is secure and open source, or which country it originates from. We can add other models or explain that we can add more models with the flexibility of the drop-down list:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="modelSelector"&gt;Model:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;select id="modelSelector"&gt;
    &lt;option value="OpenAI" selected&gt;OpenAI&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="DeepSeek"&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Finally, the output area is a standardized section for displaying conversation responses clearly and legibly:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="output-area"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversation output will appear here...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">We are now ready to write the closing tags and open the file:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The <code class="inlineCode">01.html</code> file <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>was created with a basic text editor, uploaded to our GitHub repository, and then downloaded automatically by our notebook. You can directly open the file in a browser or within your presentation environment. In this case, we will now open it in the notebook.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"> The choice of whether to use HTML for the presentation is yours. For this particular strategy, a PowerPoint presentation may be too static, while directly running Python code risks distracting top executives from core concepts. An HTML page strikes an effective balance—more dynamic than static slides, yet clearer and more flexible than live code.</p>
      <p class="normal">I would advise, however, that you keep your focus on the message, not the medium. Articulate the human-centric and automated gains that will take your audience to the next level.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Let’s now outline the seven-step roadmap we’ll follow to effectively showcase our GenAISys before exploring each component in greater depth in the upcoming sections:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="keyWord">Present the core GenAISys</strong> by focusing on the practical features of the GenAISys. Don’t get lost in low-level technical terms about Python, CSS, HTML, or anything else. There is only one goal: to show the audience how this interface can help them build a human-centered, next-generation GenAISys.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Present the vector store</strong> to show how an organization’s data can be safely stored in an innovative manner. The concept to convey is that the data is not static and stored in a single location, but rather dynamic. We can access the data directly, just like a GPS in our car.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">A human-centric approach to KPIs</strong> to show that although we can automate many tasks, a human-centered system can be a profit center. If humans have real-time KPIs to prove productivity gains in real time, a powerful collaborative human-AI team will take a company to the next level.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Integrating platforms and frameworks</strong> can be an option. It will be up to the company to decide. We demonstrate our expertise in building a GenAISys from scratch. We are thus valuable assets to deploy the complex functions that any GenAISys requires, whether through a platform or not. We will also demonstrate that we can integrate powerful MASs to enhance the company’s productivity.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Security and privacy </strong>are key components of a project. We will demonstrate that we can implement standard practices in this field based on the best practices and regulations currently available on the market.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Customization </strong>is our brand image! We have demonstrated our ability to build a cutting-edge GenAISys from scratch. We are thus able to customize any AI features that are required.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">GenAISys resources (RACI) </strong>are our realistic touch. We know how hard it is to build a GenAISys. We<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> recognize that transitioning from a model to a system is a complex process. We recognize that the one-to-one, user-to-copilot experience alone is insufficient. We have a one-to-many vision, an architecture that scales to groups of users, which requires careful resource planning.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">With that roadmap in place, let’s begin by presenting the core GenAISys.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>1. Presenting the core GenAISys</h2>
    <p class="normal">Navigate <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>to the <em class="italic">1. The Generative AI Chat Interface</em> section of the notebook, and run the following cell to display the <code class="inlineCode">01.html</code> page:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">display_interface("/content/01.html")
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This output mirrors exactly the IPython interface we have carefully developed throughout the book. However, by displaying it as a web page, we emphasize that our GenAISys interface is platform-independent—it can be hosted anywhere, embedded in presentations, or accessed via web browsers, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 10.3</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.3: Generative AI Chat Interface" src="img/B32304_10_3.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.3: Generative AI Chat Interface</p>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>descriptions provided during your presentation need to be user-friendly and intuitive. You must adapt your level of technical terminology to the audience. Start with clear terms and then expand when necessary to provide more technical or even more straightforward explanations as needed. The flexibility of our explanations must match the flexibility of the GenAISys we’ve built.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following are some ways to address the many questions an audience can ask and what we must address. The <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>technical details have been described throughout the book. The idea here is to prepare you to answer tricky questions. Let’s go through each component:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Generative AI chat interface</strong>: This term is intuitive. The customer can choose any other term that suits the project’s needs.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">User</strong>: Explain that your GenAISys possesses multi-user functionality. We can limit the user to one or expand it to <em class="italic">n</em> users. Each user can have a specific name, such as “John Doe,” a role, such as “Marketing,” or any other username depending on the project. In this case, the user is selected from a list:</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.4: Manual or automatic user selection" src="img/B32304_10_4.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.4: Manual or automatic user selection</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Your message</strong>: We need to explain that the user message can contain keywords decided by the customer. The messages will thus trigger AI behaviors such as text generation, image generation, reasoning (<strong class="keyWord">chain of thought</strong>, or <strong class="keyWord">CoT</strong>), and advanced text analysis. At this point, we can refer to the use cases we wish to present. Depending on the scope of the presentation, you can decide to drill down (toggle to the Google Colab notebook or your local installation) and show your use cases or not. Don’t forget to explain that a full conversation can be saved and summed up.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Agent, Voice Output, and Files checkboxes</strong>: We can explain these options and decide whether to drill down or not, depending on the customer’s interest. You can also expand with creative ideas if they are within the scope of the project the customer is looking for.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Reasoning</strong>: The reasoning agents will show how effective your GenAISys can be. Make sure to describe the options in <em class="italic">Figure 10.5</em> to showcase the power of the GenAISys when it comes to neuroscientific text analysis, CoT generation, or generic mobility features. Briefly explain the CoT approaches discussed in this book. Go into detail if asked using Google Pro or your local installation (personal computer or server).</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.5: Selecting a reasoning function" src="img/B32304_10_5.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.5: Selecting a reasoning function</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model</strong>: The choice of model, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.6</em>, perfectly illustrates the system’s flexibility. The<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> customer can decide to use an API or a locally installed open source model. Explain that the GenAISys can support other models if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.6: Selecting a generative AI model" src="img/B32304_10_6.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.6: Selecting a generative AI model</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Output area</strong>: We can explain that the output generates text and images. If requested, we can decide whether to show an example.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We can conclude by explaining that the GenAISys interface is just the frontend. The GenAISys proof of concept is a sophisticated, scalable, and secure structure. The interface provides a seamless, multi-user, high-performance system that allows interactions from around the world. Also explain that this proof of concept can be deployed seamlessly onto cloud services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, or Google Cloud. At this point, we can delve into the details of the functionality developed in this book and adapted to the specific use case at hand.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>2. Presenting the vector store</h2>
    <p class="normal">A <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>vector store <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>is an important component of the GenAISys you built. First, explain that Pinecone was implemented, but that you can implement another vector store if needed. Then, demonstrate how visual elements can inform the user of the Pinecone index’s status on the frontend interface.</p>
    <p class="normal">Start by duplicating <code class="inlineCode">01.html</code> to a new file named <code class="inlineCode">02.html</code> to keep the interface’s initial presentation as it was. Why? A fully populated web interface can confuse your audience, but a step-by-step approach assures you don’t lose anybody along the way. Also, maybe the customer might not want to see the Pinecone connection. Or the customer might not want to go further and start the project with <code class="inlineCode">01.html</code>. We must remain flexible and adaptable in case of all these scenarios.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <code class="inlineCode">02.html</code>, first add a clear Pinecone connection indicator:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Generative AI Chat Interface&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;!-- Pinecone Connection Status --&gt;
  &lt;div id="pineconeStatus" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;&amp;#9679;&lt;/span&gt; Connected to Pinecone Index
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- Existing form elements --&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The customer may also want to review the Pinecone retrieval before augmenting the input to the generative AI model. We could add a new section, in this case:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;div class="output-area"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No results yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <p class="normal">We can then run the cell to display the interface:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.7: Enhancing the interface with Pinecone features</p>
    <p class="normal">To present <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>Pinecone, we could drill down further and show the structure of a vector store by going to our Pinecone console at <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">https://www.pinecone.io/</a>. You <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>can summarize what was covered in <a href="Chapter_3.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic"> </em>while showing the <code class="inlineCode">Chapter03/Pinecone_RAG.ipynb</code> version of the notebook with a checklist such as the following one:</p>

      <li class="bulletList">Upserting</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Querying</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Before drilling down into a notebook, however, make sure your audience understands the meaning of vectors and vector stores. Otherwise, simply explain that the vector store provides a highly efficient way of retrieving data and augmenting generative AI inputs to obtain better results.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can also run <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>any other notebook that queries the Pinecone index or one you built. Note that the notebooks in this book are educational, so you might want to build on them to create your own notebooks for a presentation. Let’s now introduce KPIs in a human-centric environment.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>3. Human-centric approach to KPIs</h2>
    <p class="normal">A <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>human-centric implementation of a GenAISys remains the best way to deploy AI. A human-centered approach seems counterintuitive at first. Why not just replace employees? Why not lay off all the people who can be replaced? Why not get a lot of cash out of firing employees? After all, why not drastically reduce the workforce since a GenAISys can save so much time and money? Why not simply invest the money and earn a rapid ROI? A simple, counter-intuitive <em class="italic">ROI Scenario 1</em> through layoffs or “replacement” would look as follows:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B32304_10_Equation1.png"/></figure>
    <p class="normal">Indeed, certain corporations have pursued extensive layoffs, choosing to rely heavily on AI. They might even appear successful. However, before following that path, consider my personal experience and perspective, then choose how you wish to proceed. Let’s go through my vision of ROI through growth.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>ROI through growth</h3>
    <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 10.8</em> illustrates <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>my vision of AI implementations and policy based on real-life AI projects over the past decades. It represents ROI by increasing sales through GenAISys neuroscientific marketing, decreasing time to market production-to-delivery with generative AI, including CoT, and boosting sales with a GenAISys.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.8: Evolution through growth" src="img/B32304_10_8.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.8: Evolution through growth</p>
    <p class="normal">How is that possible? Am I an idealist? Let me break this down with a real-life AI project I implemented<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> for a distribution center in a mega-warehouse of 100,000+ square meters, which is roughly 1.076+ million square feet. The project was a ground-up hybrid AI and advanced mathematics project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The AI location optimizer determined in which location the warehouse should be built by calculating the barycenter of thousands of deliveries from the production sites (A) to the distribution centers (B) and then to the local customers (C), such as supermarkets and large stores, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.9</em>:</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.9: Mega-warehouse AI-driven optimization" src="img/B32304_10_9.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.9: Mega-warehouse AI-driven optimization</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The internal warehouse AI agent optimized the warehouse’s design, including the number of piers and zones.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The AI warehouse agent then optimized the flow from the piers to the storage locations (from A) and from the storage to the piers for delivery (C).</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The key issue was the number of messages for large, unplanned events, such as late truck arrivals (due to traffic or weather) and faulty products. A GenAISys, such as the one we built in this book and adapted to this use case, could automate these messages to a certain extent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">So why not replace the many planners who work 24/7 to solve these issues automatically? Everybody first thought this was possible. I found that this could be done to a certain extent. However, I discovered quickly that many parameters the planners considered were not predictable. Generative AI, or even rule-based systems, excel at detecting <em class="italic">patterns</em> but are at a loss when <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>there are none! They struggle significantly when encountering unprecedented, non-repeating scenarios.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider this actual warehouse scenario: stickers are missing from crate #100234, while another crate contains a faulty product (#343445). Simultaneously, an <strong class="keyWord">automated guided vehicle</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AGV</strong>) is inexplicably <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>operating slower than usual. The truck at Pier 94 must depart immediately, as it’s nearly 11:00 p.m. on a Saturday, and trucks cannot use highways on Sundays. Any delay now risks severe penalties and customer dissatisfaction.</p>
    <p class="normal">I found that many similar problems occurred daily. So, yes, a hybrid GenAISys with powerful mathematical functions could automate many decision-making processes. And yes, this represented a lot of gross margins over a year in large warehouses. But what about all the unsolved problems that an AI cannot solve? Remember, in distribution supply chains, late deliveries incur stiff penalties and possibly customer distrust, leading to the loss of many contracts.</p>
    <p class="normal">At that point, I worked 24/7 on another approach. Let’s keep the personnel, especially the planners, even if increased productivity requires fewer personnel overall in the warehouse. Why and how? I designed an interface that contained a KPI like the one we will add in this section with an AI agent and a human expert. <em class="italic">Figure 10.10</em> illustrates how an expert can visualize KPIs in real time. Every time the expert ran the AI system and completed the decision, taking complex unplanned events into account, the system displayed how much money was saved, such as not having to use a second truck, switching orders to optimize personnel, and having the extra time to fix errors.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.10: Human-centric GenAISys collaboration" src="img/B32304_10_10.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.10: Human-centric GenAISys collaboration</p>
    <p class="normal">The expert planner thus increased the speed of the incoming and outgoing storage events. The warehouse<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> could process more units without having to build additional piers, purchase new AGVs, or hire more hands. The productivity gains represented a 3% gross margin increase for the mega-warehouse. Such a significant surge in gross margin in warehouse management generated substantial profit.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can design the ROI ratio with the parameters you wish, but the core concept is that collaborative human-AI growth is highly productive. The ROI through growth produced far more margin with a human-centric system than laying off personnel:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B32304_10_Equation2.png"/></figure>
    <p class="normal">This successful project had a huge impact on my reputation and sales:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The word spread that Rothman was ethical and that his AI systems could be trusted.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Human-centric successes built an image of AI projects that would federate teams, not destroy them.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">AI expertise could work 24/7 to help teams boost their performance, thus generating growth and obtaining bonuses!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Ultimately, the choice between aggressive layoffs and strategic growth remains yours. This example simply reflects my personal approach and experiences. In any case, if the customer wants a real-time KPI, let’s add it to the interface.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Adding a real-time KPI to the GenAISys web interface</h3>
    <p class="normal">If your customer is <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>interested, here’s how we can implement a real-time KPI into the existing web interface, emphasizing the human-centric approach:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Copy the previous interface file (<code class="inlineCode">02.html</code>) to a new version (<code class="inlineCode">03.html</code>) to preserve previous interface states. Then, add the KPI panel:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">   &lt;!-- Gross Margin KPI Panel --&gt;
   &lt;div class="kpi-panel" id="grossMarginKPI"&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Gross Margin&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;div class="kpi-value" id="grossMarginValue"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Then, we will add the CSS styling:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">   .kpi-panel {
     background: #fff;
     padding: 15px;
     margin: 20px auto;
     border: 1px solid #ccc;
     border-radius: 5px;
     text-align: center;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
     max-width: 300px;
   }
   .kpi-panel h2 {
     margin-bottom: 10px;
     font-size: 20px;
   }
   .kpi-value {
     font-size: 36px;
     font-weight: bold;
     color: #007bff;
   }
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Finally, we will add real-time update simulations in JavaScript to illustrate what the KPI would look like if implemented in real-time situations:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">   // Example function to update the KPI
   function updateGrossMargin() {
     // Replace this with your real-time data-fetching logic
     const grossMargin = fetchGrossMarginFromBackend(); // your API call here
     document.getElementById('grossMarginValue').textContent = `$${grossMargin.toFixed(2)}`;
   }
   // Simulate real-time update every 5 seconds
   setInterval(updateGrossMargin, 5000);
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>run the cell that displays <code class="inlineCode">03.html</code> in section <em class="italic">3. KPI</em> of the notebook:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">display_interface("/content/03.html")
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This simulation displays real-time updates of the gross margin KPI, visually reinforcing the value human planners bring to GenAISys implementations:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.11: A human-KPI relationship</p>
    <p class="normal">The customer may wish to delete this function or enhance it to adapt it to their project. Our role is to adapt to the project’s needs, regardless of the level of automation required. We will now proceed to present the integration of our GenAISys in the customer’s environment.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>4. Integration: Platforms and frameworks</h2>
    <p class="normal">Integration is <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>often among the most challenging stages of deploying a GenAISys, particularly when it comes to selecting platforms, operating systems, and frameworks. While start-ups or internal projects might initially have the luxury of freely selecting platforms, real-world scenarios often involve stringent constraints from investors, customers, or internal policies. The following examples are drawn from real-world situations that illustrate the potential challenges you may face:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">“Our company only works with Windows Server with ISO with native security. We will not accept your Ubuntu service. It’s not open to discussion. It’s our policy.” (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2025">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2025</a>)</li>

      <li class="bulletList">“As an investor, we need to make sure that your GenAISys meets AWS security and privacy standards<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> that adhere to US-European regulations through the <strong class="keyWord">Data Privacy Framework</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DPF</strong>). We don’t care about the third-party components you installed. Either you use AWS’s framework, or we will not invest.” (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-us-data-privacy-framework/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-us-data-privacy-framework/</a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">“Are you joking? Do you really think we are going to let you into our network with a GenAISys? Impossible. So, forget about the security and privacy components you are presenting, including AWS’s framework. You’re on a highly secure aerospace site.

The connections are monitored by our security department 24/7 in real time. Any attempt to write unauthorized prompts will be filtered before they reach your system, accompanied by a high-security alert. We will not tell you more. We’ll just give you a hint.

      <li class="bulletList">“We have been working with Google Cloud for many years and will only accept systems that fit into our hosting, security, and privacy framework.” (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/">https://cloud.google.com/</a>)</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The list of possible hosting platforms, security, and privacy frameworks is limitless! Your GenAISys proof of concept must remain <em class="italic">flexible</em>. This flexibility is why the frontend HTML page we’ve built is designed for quick adaptation to specific customer requirements—without necessitating deep modifications at the backend. Then, you can take the customer as deep as requested with the educational components built in this book and the ones you have added to prepare a professional-specific presentation.</p>
    <p class="normal">But integration<a id="_idIndexMarker690"/> doesn’t stop here! Creative and unexpected requests can arise. A potential customer might ask you the following two questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">“We really love your GenAISys! The multi-user feature is fantastic, especially since it supports activating or deactivating the AI agent! Great! We’ll purchase your system immediately if you can get it to work with the Zoom API. That would be tremendous! How long would it take you to integrate your GenAISys with Zoom?” (<a href="https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/">https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/</a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">“We love love love your Zoom integration! It’s great! But our company policy is only to use Microsoft Teams. How long would it take you to integrate your GenAISys with Teams?” (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Once you address these challenges, further integration demands may emerge around enterprise-level ERPs (such as SAP or Oracle), specific database solutions, or even certifications to authenticate your GenAISys’s compliance and security measures. For that I say, welcome to the real world! You must hold on to one basic principle: No matter how far you develop your GenAISys, potential customers will often ask for more or a different way to implement your system. Your GenAISys provides legitimacy. Beyond that, remain a flexible expert!</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s now demonstrate our willingness to adapt to any situation. Copy <code class="inlineCode">03.html</code> and name it <code class="inlineCode">04.html</code> to keep the interface’s previous step as is. Add this section to the HTML frontend page:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">    &lt;!-- ERP Integration Dropdown --&gt;

    <p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>newly added integration selection appears just below the <strong class="screenText">Reasoning</strong> dropdown (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.12</em>).

    <p class="normal">Remember, the<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> integration flexibility your GenAISys offers extends beyond these examples. It might even include MAS implementations—another sophisticated approach we will now explore.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Showcasing advanced frameworks: A MAS</h3>
    <p class="normal">At this point in <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>the presentation, you <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>can pivot from showing what your GenAISys currently does to highlighting the future it enables. Introducing a<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> MAS is not just a new feature—it’s a glimpse into the transformative potential of generative AI, demonstrating how your system’s core design can handle complex tasks. It captures the very philosophy of this book: human-centric, scalable, and collaborative AI.</p>
    <p class="normal">When deciding whether or not to present it, consider the following parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">This could be the “wow” moment because you are opening the door to the future.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">This could also be a terrifying moment for a risk-averse audience who might be scared of the implications, no matter what you say: job displacement, replacement, or destruction.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Even if it is a “wow” moment, the content might be too complex and maybe should wait until the GenAISys is in implementation. If this happens, you can add this MAS to the handler registry of the GenAISys and let a user decide whether to activate it or not.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Even if it is a “wow” moment and the audience wants to go further, remind them before letting it run on its own that the human-centered GenAISys with a human-machine interface ensures that experts control the output, even within advanced MAS implementations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">If you choose to present the <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>MAS, frame it clearly as an innovative game-changer. It can operate autonomously or partially autonomously—either standalone or through a simplified interface within your existing GenAISys.</p>
    <p class="normal">To see the full<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> implementation of this MAS, open the <code class="inlineCode">GenAISYS_&amp;_MAS.ipynb</code> notebook. The program’s flow and code are designed to be highly self-explanatory, with each section having a clear explanation of its purpose. We, meaning the human author and Gemini 2.5 Pro/ChatGPT, my co-workers for this project, have taken care to add detailed comments directly in the code to explain not just <em class="italic">what</em> the functions do but also the design decisions behind them—from the prompt engineering that guides the agents to the asynchronous patterns that enable the swarm to run efficiently.</p>
    <p class="normal">The notebook has three <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>key features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">The MAS</strong>: This notebook demonstrates an educational MAS, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.14</em>. This MAS orchestrates a swarm of AI agents for concurrent task processing. The program is organized by first setting up the asynchronous environment and defining the core components: independent worker agents that create and solve tasks, a summarizer agent for synthesis, and a central orchestrator to manage the two-stage workflow. The final cells execute the complete simulation, showcasing an efficient, parallel approach to complex problem-solving.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Human-AI co-worker collaboration paradox</strong>: Although this program demonstrates AI agents automating tasks, a concept often tied to human replacement, the notebook itself is a testament to human-AI co-worker collaboration. Authored by a human, it was then refined with ChatGPT and evolved into this MAS in partnership with Gemini. This process mirrors the book’s central, human-centric theme: the future is not AI versus humans but AI as a co-worker, augmenting our own creativity and productivity.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">“From-scratch” approach</strong>: A deliberate choice was made to build this system from foundational libraries such as <code class="inlineCode">asyncio</code> and <code class="inlineCode">aiohttp</code> rather than using a pre-existing agentic framework. This from-scratch approach serves a dual purpose. First, it demystifies the core mechanics of how multi-agent orchestration works, an educational goal of this project. Second, it ensures the resulting framework is as flexible and modular as possible, free from the constraints of any single platform, and ready to be adapted to any real-world business requirements.</li>
    </ul>

      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model A as an integrated handler</strong>: For many use cases, the entire swarm process can be encapsulated as a new function and added to the handler registry of the core GenAISys. A user could trigger this massive parallel task by simply selecting the <strong class="screenText">Swarm Processing</strong> option from the <strong class="screenText">Reasoning</strong> dropdown. This demonstrates the modularity and extensibility of the primary system.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model B as an independent, specialized service</strong>: For a massive, dedicated need (e.g., analyzing millions of documents or real-time data streams), the MAS can be deployed as a separate, highly optimized service. The main conversational GenAISys could then call this service when needed. This showcases the ability to build a robust, microservices-style architecture for enterprise-level problems.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model C as the pillar of a larger AI platform</strong>: We can frame the entire GenAISys as a platform with two main pillars. The first is the conversational and reasoning agent for human-centric collaboration. The second is the <strong class="keyWord">Swarm Intelligence Engine (MAS)</strong> for large-scale automation. This presents the most ambitious and powerful vision of the work, not just a tool but a comprehensive, business-ready AI platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This integrated vision elevates your GenAISys beyond mere functionality into a fully realized, enterprise-ready AI ecosystem.</p>
    <p class="normal">Having built your GenAISys from the ground up, you now possess a powerful, flexible AI controller capable of dynamic orchestration and advanced reasoning. This solid foundation uniquely positions you to embrace emerging standards <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>such as the <strong class="keyWord">Model Context Protocol</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MCP</strong>) and the <strong class="keyWord">Agent Communication Protocol</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">ACP</strong>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model Context Protocol</strong>: MCP offers a standardized way for your GenAISys to seamlessly access and integrate with diverse external tools and data sources. If a customer wants to implement this, you now have the skills to complete the job. You can learn more about MCP and its specifications here: <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">https://modelcontextprotocol.io/</a>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Agent Communication Protocol</strong>: ACP<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> provides the blueprint for your sophisticated AI agents to collaborate effortlessly with other specialized agents. You have built many agents throughout the book preparing you for this protocol. You can find more information about ACP and its course on DeepLearning.AI’s platform, often in partnership with IBM Research’s BeeAI: <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/agent-communication-protocol/">https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/agent-communication-protocol/</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Your expertise <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>in designing intelligent AI pipelines and agentic workflows means you are well equipped to leverage and even <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>contribute to these powerful interoperability frameworks, taking your business-ready AI solutions to the next level. Now comes a more difficult aspect: security constraints and privacy regulations.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>5. Security and privacy</h2>
    <p class="normal">Security and privacy<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> often inherit constraints from the selected hosting platforms or frameworks decided in the initial integration phase. However, even if your system aligns with established standards, you must clearly demonstrate your moderation and data security components within the GenAISys. Always be ready to face rigorous questions on these topics. It’s strongly recommended to have a certified security expert alongside you during the presentation. If that’s not possible, ensure you demonstrate your willingness to adapt your GenAISys according to the customer’s established protocols and frameworks.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here are essential security layers that your GenAISys might need to integrate or align with—review them carefully to be ready for challenging questions, even if another team or external service manages these security layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Encrypted communications</strong>: Communicate how data encryption is managed. Refer to robust resources such as IBM’s overview of encryption to ensure you’re prepared (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/encryption">https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/encryption</a>).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Audit reports and penetration testing</strong>: Customers often demand proof of regular security testing. Make sure you understand the penetration testing standards of major providers such as AWS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/</a>).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Access controls and authentication</strong>: Discuss how your GenAISys integrates with industry-standard access management protocols. Familiarize yourself with frameworks such as Google Cloud’s access control methodologies (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/</a>).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Monitoring and incident response</strong>: Articulate your system’s ability to handle security incidents. It’s beneficial to reference frameworks such as IBM’s incident response guidelines (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/incident-response">https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/incident-response</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">You don’t<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> have to be an expert, but at minimum, you should comfortably discuss these areas using accurate terminology. Review the provided links carefully to ensure you are up to date with contemporary security practices.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s showcase how your system might handle real-time security alerts effectively. As usual, to avoid overwhelming your audience, copy <code class="inlineCode">04.html</code> to create <code class="inlineCode">05.html</code>, ensuring the previous presentation state remains untouched if you decide not to proceed further in the demonstration.</p>
    <p class="normal">We’ll add a simple, visually intuitive red alert banner to our flexible HTML interface:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;!-- Place this alert banner near the top of your container --&gt;
&lt;div id="securityAlert" style="display:none; background-color: #ffdddd; color: #a94442; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ebccd1; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Security Alert:&lt;/strong&gt; Suspicious activity detected.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Then, in your JavaScript, you can easily toggle its visibility based on certain conditions:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">// Example function to display the alert
function showSecurityAlert() {
  document.getElementById('securityAlert').style.display = 'block';
}
// Example function to hide the alert
function hideSecurityAlert() {
  document.getElementById('securityAlert').style.display = 'none';
}
// Simulate a security event after 5 seconds (for demonstration purposes)
setTimeout(showSecurityAlert, 5000);
red alert banner / 5 seconds
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">In this example, the alert banner appears automatically after five seconds, visually illustrating how a real-time security notification might look. Read the code to be able to modify it in real time or at least rapidly during a meeting if requested. Some customers might dislike the way it’s displayed or its color.</p>
    <p class="normal">Sometimes, modifying <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>the frontend page shows your willingness to adapt to the customer’s needs quickly, as we’ve reiterated several times now. On the other hand, careful and considered modifications signal caution and reliability. Make a strategic choice depending on your understanding of your audience’s needs and expectations.</p>
    <p class="normal">The alert can come from your system or the hosting environment. Now, let’s run the code to display the updated interface:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">display_interface("/content/05.html")
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">A security alert will be displayed after five seconds, as illustrated here:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.16: A security alert banner in real time" src="img/B32304_10_16.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.16: A security alert banner in real time</p>
    <p class="normal">The security alert conditions must be precisely defined during the project’s implementation stage to ensure alignment with the customer’s exact security policy. With security and privacy considerations addressed, let’s now move on to the nuanced and often challenging area of customization.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>6. Customization</h2>
    <p class="normal">As with most <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>software, the GenAISys’s path to success relies on our ability to customize an application. No matter how hard we try, the end users will request interface and process evolutions. We can ignore them or accept them. The middle ground is to accept the requests that are feasible and within the scope of the project, and find as many realistic workarounds as possible for evolutions that would require fundamental modifications.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are many possible customization approaches; here, we focus on a practical three-phase, human-centric customization method:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Phase 1</strong>: Customizing the frontend HTML page through brainstorming workshops with as many groups as necessary</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Phase 2</strong>: Creating an isolated sandbox to add features to the GenAISys you built progressively</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Phase 3</strong>: Integrating the sandbox evolutions step by step in the HTML page (documentation and stabilization)</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.17: A three-phase human-centric customization process" src="img/B32304_10_17.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.17: A three-phase human-centric customization process</p>
    <p class="normal">All three phases <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>will progress continuously in workshop cycles. Reinforce your participants’ roles as active co-creators, rather than passive consumers of technology who only express their wishes.</p>
    <p class="normal">Again, copy <code class="inlineCode">05.html</code> and name it <code class="inlineCode">06.html</code>. Add some icons to trigger reactions from the audience so that they can express their creativity, ideas, and needs. If you succeed in involving your audience, you’re already on your way to success.</p>
    <p class="normal">The icons in this code come from Font Awesome. They are made available by including the <code class="inlineCode">Font Awesome</code> CSS library via a link in <code class="inlineCode">&lt;head&gt;</code>. Then, the icons are inserted throughout the HTML using <code class="inlineCode">&lt;i&gt;</code> tags with the appropriate Font Awesome classes. Here are the key snippets that you can customize in real time or near-real time during your workshops:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Import the <code class="inlineCode">Font Awesome</code> library:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css"&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Integrate<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> the icons in the HTML:<ul>
          <li class="bulletList">Gross margin KPI panel header:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-chart-line"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Gross Margin&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li class="bulletList">User selector label:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;label for="userSelector"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-user"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; User:&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li class="bulletList">Message input label:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;label for="messageInput"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-comment"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Your Message:&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li class="bulletList">Send button:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;button id="sendButton" title="Send your message"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-paper-plane"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Send&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li class="bulletList">Reasoning selector label:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;label for="reasoningSelector"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-brain"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Reasoning:&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li class="bulletList">Model selector label:
            <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;label for="modelSelector"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-robot"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Model:&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre>fas fa-chart-line</code>, <code class="inlineCode">fas fa-user</code>, etc.), ensuring clear visual communication of each component’s purpose. Here, too, you’ll have to be prepared to swiftly modify these icons in real time during workshops to demonstrate your agility in adapting to user feedback.</pre>
    <p class="normal">Now, run the web page to visualize your icon-rich interface:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">display_interface("/content/06.html")
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The page now contains icons, as illustrated in the following excerpt of the HTML page:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.18: Customizing the web page with icons" src="img/B32304_10_18.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.18: Customizing the web page with icons</p>
    <p class="normal">Do not take<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> this topic lightly! An end user only sees the frontend web page and its outputs (text, images, and popups). Spend all the necessary time listening to the customer (your colleagues or external customers). The more the end users work with you in this area, the more it becomes <em class="italic">their</em> GenAISys.</p>
    <p class="normal">The tricky part is fitting in phase 2 (GenAISys) development and phase 3 (GenAISys and web page integration). You can fast-track the project by implementing all three phases in parallel, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 10.19</em>.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.19: Working in teams on all three phases in parallel on-site or remotely" src="img/B32304_10_19.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.19: Working in teams on all three phases in parallel on-site or remotely</p>
    <p class="normal">The choice depends on the project and your vision. Your deployment approach will create the continual momentum required for a fast-tracked, eventful, optimized time-to-market project. However, each <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>project advances at its own speed, and the best pace is the one the users choose, giving them time to adapt to your cutting-edge GenAISys.</p>
    <p class="normal">At some point, you will inevitably need to explain the resources required for the project and its associated costs. So, let’s move on and discuss that.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>7. GenAISys resources (RACI)</h2>
    <p class="normal">Every<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> successful software project clearly specifies the human and machine resources required. Machine resources usually align closely with the platforms identified during the earlier integration discussion (refer to the <em class="italic">Integration: Platforms and frameworks</em> section in this chapter). Human resources, however, require more careful consideration and explicit detailing using a structured approach such as the <strong class="keyWord">RACI</strong> matrix outlined in <a href="Chapter_1.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>. Recall that a <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>RACI matrix classifies project responsibilities into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">R (Responsible)</strong>: The person(s) who works actively on the task</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">A (Accountable)</strong>: The person(s) who is answerable for the success or failure of a task</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">C (Consulted)</strong>: In a complex project, this is the person(s) providing input, advice, and feedback to help the others in a team, but they are not responsible for executing the work</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">I (Informed)</strong>: These are the people who are kept informed about a task’s progress or outcome</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Section 7 (RACI)</em> of the notebook provides a practical example of a RACI matrix specifically designed for the GenAISys we’ve developed in this book. <em class="italic">Figure 10.20</em> shows an excerpt from this RACI ideation, providing a concrete starting point to build your project-specific RACI:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Figure 10.20: Excerpt of the RACI ideation for the GenAISys built in this book" src="img/B32304_10_20.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.20: Excerpt of the RACI ideation for the GenAISys built in this book</p>
    <p class="normal">While<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> presenting, you will need to explain that the <strong class="screenText">RACI Matrix for GenAISys Implementation</strong> ideation clearly outlines a coordinated, cross-functional approach to deploying an advanced AI system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The project manager provides overall strategic oversight and leads planning and documentation</li>
      <li class="bulletList">At the same time, the AI/ML engineer drives the technical aspects—ranging from DeepSeek activation and model integration to API setups, machine learning functionalities, and comprehensive testing</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The DevOps engineer’s responsibility is to set up the environment, configure hardware resources, and manage deployment and scalability</li>
      <li class="bulletList">In contrast, the software developer focuses on coding interactive interfaces and handler registries and supporting features such as text to speech</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Meanwhile, the business/CTO role offers strategic guidance, ensures key decisions are aligned with organizational goals, and upholds compliance and security measures, ensuring every stage—from initial setup through ongoing maintenance—is effectively managed</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Using the<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> RACI matrix as your reference point will take you directly to the costs you must estimate and negotiate (in your company, for investors, or with a customer). Clearly defined roles will help you put a number to the human hours, allocate budgets effectively, and identify areas requiring specialized expertise. This allows you to transparently estimate project costs, negotiate resource allocation internally or externally, and segment your project into manageable milestones or deliverables.</p>
    <p class="normal">And with that, you are now business-ready for a GenAISys. The market is yours to conquer!</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we designed a strategic framework for showcasing a business-ready GenAISys amid intense market competition. We saw that technological innovation alone is not enough to secure customers or funding. A compelling business narrative must accompany the technical proof of concept to demonstrate real-world value. One fast-track approach is to begin with a concise introduction of the team and quickly establish our credibility and expertise. Then, pivot the presentation to a clear explanation of the GenAISys we have built, underpinned by real-time KPIs.</p>
    <p class="normal">We designed a <em class="italic">flexible</em> frontend web page to demonstrate the system’s capabilities. The idea is to have an adaptable HTML page that can be modified in real time or rapidly, depending on the situation. The frontend web page translates the IPython interface we built into an accessible, customizable HTML display. Live data updates and real-time simulations reinforce the system’s practical impact. We designed a narrative that stresses the GenAISys’s adaptability and ability to evolve with customer needs. At all times, you saw how you could drill down into the main concepts taught in this book and enhance them with your developments. You also have your own GenAISys built from scratch and ready to present, which can be adapted to the specifications of the project you are working on.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter favored a human-centric approach, ensuring AI augments rather than replaces expert decision-making. The system is positioned as a collaborative tool designed to boost operational efficiency. Real-time KPIs can reinforce the GenAISys’s profitability and strengthen the bonds between the GenAISys and the teams using it. Innovative features such as vector stores enhance data retrieval for improved outputs. We showed how to present a forward-looking vision by demonstrating a prospective evolution of the system into a swarm-based MAS, proving the framework’s scalability and introducing the powerful narrative of human-AI co-worker collaboration. We presented integration with major cloud platforms and ERP systems. We showed the possibility of integrating services such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, highlighting the versatility. Security and privacy were addressed rigorously through possible real-time alerts and adaptive measures.</p>
    <p class="normal">Flexibility remains key, enabling the system to meet diverse enterprise requirements. The approach balances cutting-edge technology with tangible business outcomes. An iterative process encourages customization based on ongoing client feedback. We presented interactive workshops as a means of tailoring the system on the fly. A RACI matrix was introduced to delineate roles and streamline project management clearly. Ultimately, the chapter provided a comprehensive blueprint for deploying a dynamic, market-ready GenAISys presentation. We balanced technical depth with clear business benefits.</p>
    <p class="normal">You are now business-ready to design, build, and deliver a GenAISys!</p>
