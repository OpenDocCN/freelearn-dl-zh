- en: From foundational concepts to complex implementations, this book offers a detailed
    exploration of how RAG can control and enhance AI systems by tracing each output
    to its source document. RAG’s traceable process allows human feedback for continual
    improvements, minimizing inaccuracies, hallucinations, and bias. This AI book
    shows you how to build a RAG framework from scratch, providing practical knowledge
    on vector stores, chunking, indexing, and ranking. You’ll discover techniques
    in optimizing performance and costs, improving model accuracy by integrating human
    feedback, balancing costs with when to fine-tune, and improving accuracy and retrieval
    speed by utilizing embedded-indexed knowledge graphs.

    into the complexities of RAG-driven generative AI by focusing on embedding vectors
    and their storage solutions. We explore the transition from raw data to organized
    vector stores using Activeloop Deep Lake and OpenAI models, detailing the process
    of creating and managing embeddings that capture deep semantic meanings. You will
    learn to build a scalable, multi-team RAG pipeline from scratch in Python by dissecting
    the RAG ecosystem into independent components. By the end, you’ll be equipped
    to handle large datasets with sophisticated retrieval capabilities, enhancing
    generative AI outputs with embedded document vectors.'
