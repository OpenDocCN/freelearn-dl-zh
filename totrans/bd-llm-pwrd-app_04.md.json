It should be in the form of \"ax + b = c,\" where 'a' is the coefficient of the variable, 'x' is the variable, 'b' is a constant, and 'c' is another constant.\n2\\. **Isolate the Variable:** Your goal is to isolate the variable 'x' on one side of the equation. To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n   a. **Add or Subtract Constants:** Add or subtract 'b' from both sides of the equation to move constants to one side.\n\n   b. **Divide by the Coefficient:** Divide both sides by 'a' to isolate 'x'. If 'a' is zero, the equation may not have a unique solution.\n3\\. **Simplify:** Simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible.\n4\\. **Solve for 'x':** Once 'x' is isolated on one side, you have the solution. It will be in the form of 'x = value.'\n5\\. **Check Your Solution:** Plug the found value of 'x' back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. If it does, you've found the correct solution.\n6\\. **Express the Solution:** Write down the solution in a clear and concise form.\n7\\. **Consider Special Cases:** Be aware of special cases where there may be no solution or infinitely many solutions, especially if 'a' equals zero.\nEquation:\n\"\"\" \n```", "```py\nequation = \"3x + 5 = 11\"\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", # engine = \"deployment_name\".\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": equation},\n    ]\n)\n#print(response)\nprint(response['choices'][0]['message']['content']) \n```", "```py\n1\\.
