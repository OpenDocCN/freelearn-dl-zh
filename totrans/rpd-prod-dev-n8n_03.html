			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Chapter <a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>2</em>: <a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Using the Editor UI to Create Workflows</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to use n8n's <strong class="bold">Editor UI</strong>. This will help you find the different functionalities of n8n. You will also learn about the different kinds of nodes in n8n and how to use them. You will then learn about building workflows and dealing with dynamic data to handle different kinds of scenarios. You will finally create your first workflow in n8n.</p>
			<p>This chapter will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to the Editor UI</li>
				<li>Exploring the regular and trigger nodes</li>
				<li>Expressions – using dynamic data</li>
				<li>Workflows – putting it all together</li>
				<li>Creating your first workflow – Hello World</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This is a list of technical requirements to prepare before continuing with the chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Have n8n installed.</li>
				<li>Ensure n8n is running and the Editor UI is open.</li>
				<li>Create an account on Telegram.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Introduction to the Editor UI</h1>
			<p>The Editor<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> UI is a graphical interface that allows you to create automations using a node-based approach. n8n takes its inspiration for node-based visualization from the film and television industry, where many tools have a node-based system. Let's take a look at<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> what we have here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.01_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – The Editor UI in n8n&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – The Editor UI in n8n</p>
			<p>Let's start from the top left. You can expand the menu by clicking on the <strong class="bold">&gt;</strong> button beneath the n8n logo. </p>
			<p>For now, we'll get ourselves familiar with the interface so that we can quickly find our way through n8n. We'll dive deeper into specific sections, such as <strong class="bold">Executions</strong>, as we progress through the chapters in this book. Let's take a look at the menu bar on the left.</p>
			<p>First of all, we have the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> menu. In the menu, we have the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">New</strong>: Create a new workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open</strong>: Open an existing workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Save</strong>: Save changes to the current workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Save As</strong>: Save the current workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rename</strong>: Rename the current workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delete</strong>: Delete the current workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Download</strong>: Download the workflow as a JSON file.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Import from URL</strong>: Import a workflow from a URL.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Import from File</strong>: Import a workflow from a JSON file.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Settings</strong>: Configure the settings for the current workflow.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please note that <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>some of these options will be grayed out since we haven't saved the workflow.</p>
			<p>Next, we have the <strong class="bold">Credentials</strong> menu. In this menu, we have two options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">New</strong>: Create a new credential.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open</strong>: Open an existing credential. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>n8n allows you to connect to many different applications, services, and APIs. A lot of these require credentials to authenticate yourself. n8n enables you to encrypt and save these credentials in its database so that they can be quickly reused when building workflows.</p>
			<p>Next up, we have the <strong class="bold">Executions</strong> tab, which opens up a modal (popup) where you can view the executions of your different workflows. You can also filter the executions by their name and status.</p>
			<p>Finally, we have the <strong class="bold">Help</strong> tab, which lists resources that will be useful for you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Documentation</strong>: A link to the n8n docs. The n8n docs contain detailed information on each node, example workflows, and references.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forum</strong>: n8n has a very active and friendly community. If you get stuck on anything, feel free to drop a question there and someone will help you resolve it.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflows</strong>: This page lists workflows that have been submitted by the community. It's a great place to gain some inspiration for your next automation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">About n8n</strong>: This option opens up a modal with details about n8n's version, a link to the GitHub repository, and the license.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the bottom left, you'll see options to zoom in and out of the canvas. The canvas is the grid of boxes in the Editor UI where you'll be adding the nodes to create workflows. You'll also notice that all new n8n workflows have a <strong class="bold">Start</strong> node.</p>
			<p>At the bottom center<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> of the Editor UI, you'll notice a button labeled <strong class="bold">Execute Workflow</strong>. This is useful for manually executing the workflows that you have created in n8n. Workflows can run in two ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manual executions</strong>: These are useful for testing your workflows while you are building <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>them or for one-off executions. An example of one-off execution can be a workflow that migrates all the data from a CSV file to Google Sheets. You can manually execute a workflow by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Execute Workflow</strong> button.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated executions</strong>: Once your automations are ready, most of the time, you'd want them to run at<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> regular intervals or when a specific event occurs. For this to happen, you'll need to activate a workflow. You can do so by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Active</strong> button at the top left, which will change the state of the toggle from inactive to active. Please note that you'll need to first save the workflow before being able to activate it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, we have the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button on the right side of the Editor UI. Clicking on it will reveal the <strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> panel. You can use this to add new nodes to the canvas and build out your workflow. You'll notice that it has three categories: <strong class="bold">All</strong>, <strong class="bold">Regular</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Trigger</strong>. Let's learn a bit more about nodes in n8n to understand what these sections mean.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Exploring the regular and trigger nodes</h1>
			<p>Nodes <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. Nodes can connect to applications, services, and APIs, and do anything that is possible with Node.js in general. Each node performs tasks based on its design. Upon completion, the data is passed on to the next node. This data is the result of the work performed by the configured task in the previous node.</p>
			<p>Each node has an input (left) side and an output (right) side. If a node's output connects to a second node's input, the second node receives the outcome of the first node as its input. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We will cover specific nodes in greater detail later on in the book.</p>
			<p>From an abstract point of view, there are two types of nodes in n8n:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regular nodes</strong>: Regular nodes<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> are useful for things such as handling <strong class="bold">Create, Read, Update, and Delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRUD</strong>) operations with<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> applications and <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>APIs, transforming data, and pulling information from the internet. Some examples of regular nodes include the following:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Airtable node</strong>: It<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> can read, add, update, and delete data from <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>an Airtable table.</li><li><strong class="bold">Function node</strong>: It can<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> execute JavaScript code, most often to <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>manipulate workflow data.</li><li><strong class="bold">Bubble node</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>node allows you to create, delete, update, and <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>get objects from Bubble.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can find the whole list of regular nodes in the latest version of n8n by heading over to the <strong class="bold">Apps &amp; nodes</strong> page of the n8n website (<a href="https://n8n.io/integrations">https://n8n.io/integrations</a>) and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Regular</strong> tab (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>):</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Some of the regular nodes that n8n comes with</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trigger nodes</strong>: Trigger nodes<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> start the execution of a workflow. These nodes <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>can start a workflow based on events such as time-based intervals or events from external systems. You need a trigger node in a workflow if you want it to execute automatically. You cannot activate workflows unless they have a trigger node. A couple of examples of trigger nodes include the following:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Cron node</strong>: This node can <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>be configured to activate a workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>every minute or every hour, or specify using custom Cron expressions.</li><li><strong class="bold">Telegram trigger node</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> node can be configured to activate a workflow every time a <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>Telegram bot receives a message.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can also find an exhaustive list of trigger nodes on n8n's <strong class="bold">Apps &amp; nodes</strong> page by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Trigger</strong> tab (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>):</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Some of the trigger nodes that n8n comes with</p>
			<p>Some of the nodes in n8n are referred to as core nodes. As of the time of writing, there isn't a distinction in the Editor UI for these nodes. Core nodes could be both regular or trigger nodes. These are nodes that are more general purpose, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Webhook node</strong>: Can be used to receive webhook<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> responses</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Function node</strong>: Can<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> be used to manipulate workflow data</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cron node</strong>: Can be <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>used to trigger workflows at specific intervals</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">HTTP Request node</strong>: Can be <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>used to make HTTP requests to a web page or an API endpoint</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We'll dive deeper into the core nodes in n8n in <a href="B17493_03_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Diving into Core Nodes and Data in n8n. </em>To put this concept to practice, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let's go back to the <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>Editor UI. First of all, click on the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> node so that it's highlighted. Doing this ensures that the new node that you add to the canvas will automatically connect to the highlighted node.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.04_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Highlighting the Start node by clicking on it&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Highlighting the Start node by clicking on it</p>
			<p>If you didn't do that, no worries. You can always connect two disconnected nodes by clicking on the circle in front of the node and dragging it to the rectangle of the next node.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Let's add a node to the<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> canvas by clicking on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button in the Editor UI. </li>
				<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">Hacker News</strong> into the <strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> panel and select the <strong class="bold">Hacker News</strong> node. </li>
				<li>Clicking on the node will add it to the canvas and open the node to be configured. Select <strong class="bold">All</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Resource</strong> field and click on the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button at the top right of the node panel.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.05_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Output of the Hacker News node&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Output of the Hacker News node</p>
			<p>You will notice that the <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>node returns 100 news articles from Hacker News. It produces a variety of information for each news item. Let's take a few minutes to understand what we have in the node panel.</p>
			<p>Clicking on any node in n8n will open up the node details view, which allows you to configure the node, execute it, and look at the data that was either received or generated by it.</p>
			<p>Let's start with the top left of the node panel. It says <strong class="bold">Hacker News</strong>, which is the name of the node. If you add another <strong class="bold">Hacker News</strong> node to the workflow, it will be called <strong class="bold">Hacker News1</strong>, and so on. You can rename a node so that it's easy to gain context later on. To do that, click on the node name, type in the new name, and click on the tick icon. Let's rename it to <strong class="source-inline">Get news</strong> for now.</p>
			<p>Under the name of the node, we have two tabs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Parameters</strong>: This tab contains parameters to configure the task. Most of the nodes have the <strong class="bold">Resource</strong> and <strong class="bold">Operation</strong> fields. They are a way to bundle together the wide variety of functionalities offered by the various applications and APIs. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>To understand this better, let's take the example of a CRM where you can store the data of individuals and companies. In n8n, a node for this CRM would have <strong class="bold">People</strong> and <strong class="bold">Company</strong> as resources. For each of the resources, it might then have create, read, update, and delete as the operations.</p>
			<p>Underneath these two fields, you would have the fields that are required, for example, <strong class="bold">Name</strong>. Like the last name, any optional fields are always bundled together under the <strong class="bold">Additional Fields</strong> section, which keeps the UI uncluttered.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Settings</strong>: This tab contains a couple of options, such as adding notes, and a couple of other settings that we'll cover later on in the book as they become relevant.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the top middle of the <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>node panel, you will see two tabs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">JSON</strong>: Clicking on this tab will showcase the data received from <strong class="bold">Hacker News</strong> in JSON format.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.06_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Viewing the output by clicking on the JSON tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Viewing the output by clicking on the JSON tab</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Table</strong>: The table view is the default view for displaying data in n8n.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the top right of the panel, you'll see the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button. This button enables you to execute this specific node manually without re-triggering the entire workflow or executing the following nodes in the workflow. This is very useful for testing the workflows while building them step by step. We then have an <strong class="bold">X</strong> button next to it. You can click on it to go back to the canvas in the Editor UI.</p>
			<p>Finally, at the bottom <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>of the node panel, you'll see a link to the node's documentation that you have opened up. Click on it to reach the node documentation, which contains example workflows with that node along with some FAQs.</p>
			<p>When working with nodes, you will often need to reference data between nodes. This data would usually be dynamic. For example, weather data might change every hour. Let's learn about how we can reference dynamic data in n8n using expressions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Expressions – using dynamic data</h1>
			<p>Consider this scenario: you<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> only want the name of the news article and the URL as part of your workflow data because the rest of the data returned by the Hacker News node is irrelevant to you. We can filter out the workflow data in a couple of ways, but we'll use the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node here. The <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node is one of the code nodes in n8n that helps you to configure workflow data To create a Set node for the aforementioned scenario, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node to the canvas and connect it to the <strong class="bold">Get news</strong> node.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.07_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Adding the Set node to the Hacker News node&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Adding the Set node to the Hacker News node</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Now, open the<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node by double-clicking on it. Toggle the <strong class="bold">Keep Only Set</strong> field to true (green). It removes all incoming workflow data and only appends the new values configured in the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node. </li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Value</strong> button and select <strong class="bold">String</strong>. You'll notice that we now have two fields: <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Value</strong>. These two fields design the JSON data structure. </li>
				<li>Delete <strong class="source-inline">propertyName</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> field and enter <strong class="source-inline">Title</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, the value of the title will be different each time the node iterates over the 100 items that it will receive from the previous node. It is also possible that those 100 values will be completely different as new articles appear on Hacker News and so on.</p>
			<p>Because of that, the <strong class="bold">Value</strong> field needs to be dynamic since the value keeps changing. You can achieve this in n8n using expressions. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">To add an expression to a field, click on the gears icon next to the field and click on <strong class="bold">Add Expression</strong>. Perform this step with the <strong class="bold">Value</strong> field. These actions will open up the Expression Editor. </li>
				<li>On the left-hand side, you'll notice the <strong class="bold">Variable Selector</strong> section. Click on the current node and go through the nesting to find the title. It should look like this:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Selecting the title of a post using the Expression Editor in n8n</p>
			<p>If the data does<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> not show up for you, check the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This node and the previous node are connected.</li>
				<li>The previous node has been executed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We'll perform the same steps for the URL and then click on the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button for the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Output of the Set node</p>
			<p>We now have only the relevant data that we wanted in the workflow, thanks to the <strong class="bold">Set </strong>node and expressions.</p>
			<p>Expressions <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>are a powerful feature in n8n. You can use them to reference data from the workflow, other nodes, the environment, and even self-generated data. Let's say we want to add a random ID to each of the news articles. Add a numerical value in the <strong class="bold">Set </strong>node, enter <strong class="source-inline">ID</strong> as the name, and click on <strong class="bold">Add Expression</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Value</strong> field.</p>
			<p>Delete the <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and enter the following: <strong class="source-inline">{{ Math.floor(Math.random() *1000) }}</strong>.</p>
			<p>Expressions can execute JavaScript between double curly braces, and here we've used it to generate three-digit random numbers. Let's say that we want the IDs to be prefixed by <strong class="source-inline">ID_</strong>. Edit the expression so that it looks like this: <strong class="source-inline">ID_{{ Math.floor(Math.random() *1000) }}</strong>. Click on the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button to see the result.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Output of the Set node after adding the ID</p>
			<p>There are many other things that you can do with <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>expressions, and we'll introduce more concepts throughout the rest of the book.</p>
			<p>Now that we know about expressions, let's learn more about workflows in n8n to understand what they are.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Workflows – putting it all together</h1>
			<p>Workflows<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> are a collection of nodes in n8n. Workflows can range anywhere from two nodes to hundreds of nodes, with workflows calling sub-workflows. These workflows can then be saved in n8n's database and activated to run on their own in the background even when you do not have the n8n Editor UI open. </p>
			<p>While each of these nodes in n8n is very powerful in and of itself, the true potential of n8n is evident when you begin to connect these nodes. In n8n, you can join one node to many other nodes. Workflows don't necessarily have to follow a linear structure. </p>
			<p>Real-world problems or tasks are usually made up of a series of steps. n8n is powerful because you can model your complex processes and tasks as a workflow, a series of nodes that each performs a step toward completing the bigger process.</p>
			<p>Let's now save the workflow created by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> icon at the top right and clicking on <strong class="bold">Save As</strong>. Let's call it <strong class="source-inline">My first workflow</strong> and press <em class="italic">Enter</em>.</p>
			<p>Workflows <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>are JSON objects. You can take a look at the underlying JSON in one of two ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> icon and click on the <strong class="bold">Download</strong> button to download the JSON file.</li>
				<li>Press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">A</em> on the canvas to select all the nodes in your workflow, press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">C</em> to copy them, head over to a text editor, and paste the JSON by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">V</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here's how the JSON for the workflow that we created appears:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.11_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – JSON for the workflow that we created&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – JSON for the workflow that we created</p>
			<p>If you look at the <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>JSON file, you'll see that it contains information about the different nodes present in your workflow, how they are connected, and the set parameters. In the preceding screenshot, you can notice the title, URL, and ID that we configured in the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> node and the expressions that we added.</p>
			<p>You can then share these files with your friends and colleagues so that they can load them on their n8n instances and run the workflows that you created. They can either import the workflow as a file or the JSON and paste it into their Editor UI.</p>
			<p>Now that we have learned about workflows, let's create our first workflow in n8n, which will send us a cocktail recipe in Telegram every day at 6 P.M.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Creating your first workflow – Hello World</h1>
			<p>Now that we are familiar with n8n's Editor UI, nodes, and workflows, let's create a new workflow that allows us to send a random cocktail recipe to Telegram every day. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> on n8n by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> icon and then clicking on <strong class="bold">New</strong>. Since this is an automation that runs every day, we'll need to add a trigger node. </li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button, click on the <strong class="bold">Trigger</strong> tab, and select the <strong class="bold">Cron</strong> node.</li>
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Cron</strong> node's details view, click on <strong class="bold">Add Cron Time</strong> and change <strong class="bold">Hour</strong> to <strong class="bold">18</strong>. By doing this, we ensure that the workflow runs every day at 1800 hours. </li>
				<li>Save the workflow and name it <strong class="bold">Hello World</strong>. Now, the workflow will be triggered at 1800 hours for the default time zone in n8n. n8n's default time zone is <strong class="bold">New York</strong>. </li>
				<li>Let's change the time zone for this specific workflow by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> icon and selecting <strong class="bold">Settings</strong>. There, you can choose your time zone. </li>
				<li>Once you have done that, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button and return to the Editor UI.</li>

				<li value="7">Now, highlight <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>the <strong class="bold">Cron</strong> node by clicking on it and then add the <strong class="bold">HTTP Request</strong> node to the canvas. Make sure that it is connected to the <strong class="bold">Cron</strong> node.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We'll use the <strong class="bold">HTTP Request</strong> node since the cocktail API does not have a node in n8n. The <strong class="bold">HTTP Request</strong> node allows us to make HTTP requests and enables us to make API calls to services that don't have a node in n8n yet. We'll be making a call to the random endpoint of the CocktailDB API.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Enter <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php">https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php</a> in the <strong class="bold">URL</strong> field of the <strong class="bold">HTTP Request</strong> node and click on the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button. You will notice that it returns details about a random cocktail.</li>

			<p>Now, we'll have to<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> send this data to Telegram. To do that, we'll first need to create a Telegram bot. You can use either the Telegram mobile app, web app, or desktop application for that. In the example screenshot (<em class="italic">Figure 2.14</em>), I am using the desktop app for macOS. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Search for <strong class="source-inline">BotFather</strong> with a blue and white "verified" symbol next to its name. To verify, click on the BotFather username.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – BotFather in the Telegram application</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Enter the <strong class="source-inline">/newbot</strong> command and follow the instructions to create your bot. You can name it as you please, but the username needs to be unique. </li>
				<li>Once completed, it <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>will give you an access token for the HTTP API. Copy that; we'll need that in n8n. Next, click on your bot link provided by BotFather and click on <strong class="bold">Start</strong>.</li>
				<li>Now head over to n8n and add a <strong class="bold">Telegram</strong> node. Make sure that the input of the Telegram node is connected to the output of the <strong class="bold">HTTP Request</strong> node. You will notice that the node has a section called <strong class="bold">Credentials</strong>. </li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Telegram API</strong> field and select <strong class="bold">Create New</strong> from the dropdown.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Create New Credentials</strong> modal will open up. Enter a name for the credentials. You can name it anything you want. I called it <strong class="source-inline">Daily Drinks Bot</strong> to differentiate it from my other Telegram bots at a glance. </li>
				<li>Now, paste the access token you copied from BotFather in the <strong class="bold">Access Token</strong> field, and click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Now, we need the chat ID. To find that, open a new tab in your web browser and go to https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;YourBOTToken&gt;/getUpdates.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Don't forget to replace <strong class="source-inline">&lt;YourBOTToken&gt;</strong> with the access token that you got from BotFather. If you see nothing on that page, send a message to your bot and open the URL again. You can then copy the chat ID from there and paste it into the <strong class="bold">Chat ID</strong> field in n8n.</p>
			<p>Now, we have to craft <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>the message for the <strong class="bold">Text </strong>field. We'll use expressions for this. Feel free to craft the message as you like. Here's how mine looked:</p>

				<li value="9">Head back to the Telegram node panel and click on the <strong class="bold">Execute Node</strong> button. You should now see a message from your bot on Telegram. Here's how mine looked:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – Message sent by our n8n workflow via the Telegram bot</p>
			<p>Now that our bot is up and<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> running, we will have to activate the workflow to get a new cocktail recipe every day at 1800 hours. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="10">Return to the canvas in the Editor UI, click on the <strong class="bold">Activate</strong> button at the top right, and select <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, then activate and save! My final workflow looks like this:</li>

			<p>As long as n8n is <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>running, you will now get cocktail recipes every evening. Congrats on creating your first n8n workflow!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about n8n's Editor UI. We then learned about the two types of nodes in n8n. We then covered expressions to reference dynamic data in n8n workflows and learned more about workflows in n8n. Finally, we created our first workflow in n8n by putting together knowledge of the Editor UI, nodes, expressions, and workflows. We'll use the principles that we've learned throughout this chapter to build workflows that will handle the backend of our products. An understanding of these topics will help with building workflows of any complexity in n8n.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we are going to dig deeper into the core nodes that make n8n so powerful. We will then take a look at how n8n workflows share data between themselves and learn how to access that information.</p>
