     Summary
    </span>
   </h1>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">
     In this chapter on performance optimization for LLMs, advanced techniques were introduced to enhance efficiency without compromising effectiveness.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.2">
     It discussed several methods, starting with quantization, which compresses models by reducing bit precision, thus shrinking model size and accelerating inference – a crucial phase where a model generates predictions.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.3">
     This involves a trade-off between model size and speed against accuracy, with tools such as quantization-aware training used to balance
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">
      these aspects.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">
     Pruning was another method discussed, focusing on eliminating less critical weights from LLMs to make them leaner and faster, which is particularly beneficial for devices with limited processing capabilities.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.2">
     Knowledge distillation was also covered, which involves transferring insights from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, simpler one (student), retaining performance while ensuring that the model is lightweight enough for real-time applications or deployment on
