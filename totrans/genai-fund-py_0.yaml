- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B21773_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Understanding Generative
    AI: An Introduction*, lays the conceptual groundwork, broadening the reader’s
    fundamental understanding of what this technology does, how it was derived, and
    how it can be used. It establishes how generative models differ from classical
    machine learning paradigms and elucidates how they discern complex relationships
    and idiosyncrasies in data to synthesize human-like text, audio, and video.'

    Natural Language Processing and the Impact of the Transformer*, covers the evolution
    of **natural language processing** (**NLP**) that ultimately led to the advent
    of the Transformer architecture. It introduces the Transformer—its basis in deep
    learning, its self-attention architecture, and its rapid evolution, which has
    led to the generative AI phenomenon.'
