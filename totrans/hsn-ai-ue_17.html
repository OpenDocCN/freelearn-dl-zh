<p>In this final chapter, we are going to discuss what we have been covered in this book, and what has been left out. There will be some general thoughts on AI and Psychology that every Game AI Developer should be aware of. Therefore, this chapter will conclude with some suggestions on how to explore the concepts that were presented (and others) in this book and some thoughts about AI.</p>
<p>It is not possible to imagine a future where <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) will not be omnipresent. It will be integrated into everything in ways that we haven't even imagined. Therefore, for AI to be designed in a way that can truly connect with human beings, psychology will need to remain at the center of the design of such experiences. Year by year, we can observe the world becoming increasingly reliant on technology, and in some cases, technology fills the void of human interaction. This allows us to interact with highly personalized and customized experiences that make up feel among a sea of individuals truly unique.</p>
<p>Often, AI programmers forget who they are implementing the system for: the players. As such, psychology plays an important role: how an AI system is perceived by the player is more important than the performance of the system itself. <span>This chapter explores this link between the psychology of the player and AI in games.</span></p>
<p><span>In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="h1">Why is psychology an important consideration for AI?</li>
<li class="h1">What we haven't covered in this book</li>

<p>By now, you may have begun to suspect why psychology is an integral part of the development of artificial intelligence. Psychology is important because it teaches us about the fundamental reasoning behind how humans think and behave. Therefore, it makes sense for us to find ways to incorporate this into our designs when it comes to personalizing, customizing, and automating experiences for users. When considering the autonomous role of AI within an interactive experience, it must, in some way, align with how we, as players, interact and engage with the virtual world; how we interact with objects, <strong>non-roleplaying characters</strong> (<strong>NPCs</strong>), and other players. One way to think of this is via cause and effect. For example, we perform a particular action such as stealing from different characters or behaving badly, and that, in turn, will have an effect on how other NPCs respond to you. An excellent example of this is in the game Overlord, where the more that you go out of your way to terrorize villages, the less likely and willing they are to help you or even interact with you. While it can be humorous, it can be quite frustrating too, especially when you need to achieve certain objectives and are forced to do it the hard way because now everyone hates you! Therefore, remember that to create AI within games, you need to define a metric to evaluate the progress of the player and tweak it accordingly as you begin to playtest your game.</p>
<p>There are many ways that psychology is used in conjunction with AI. For example, many websites use Recommendation Systems that either pay attention to what you purchase or look at and make suggestions based on that. This can either be done while you're browsing catalogs, adding items to your cart, or even via email to lure you back in with "personalized promotions".</p>

<p>More specifically in games, AI is used quite extensively. Unlike AI, machine learning has the possibility to be implemented within a game, but given the brevity of most gaming experiences, there is often not enough data to go on for the machine to really "learn" anything, let alone apply it to gameplay. Therefore, it is not really an economically nor resource viable option. In this instance, the saying "just because you can, doesn't mean you should" would be the most sensible approach to this situation.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>More specifically talking, the use of psychology in AI can target many other areas, such as playing on a character's (and player's) emotions. In an era of emerging technologies and ways to use them, we find that some games set out to make the game feel "real" for the player. The developers try to find ways to cross the threshold of reality and game and really encourage the player to make morally questionable choices (e.g. Spec Ops: The Line, Heavy Rain), ones of which really tug on the heartstrings and make us even reflect on our own behavior.</p>
<p>Some games aim to "psychologically" profile you while you are playing. For example, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, uses psychological profiling to get to know you and then uses this information to change the game while you are playing it, to, as they put it, create your own personal nightmare.</p>
<p>This is very intuitively done via a part within the game where a psychologist where Dr. Michael Kaufmann—or Dr. K—asks you a range of different questions to begin the profiling process. But this is only the basis of the profiling—the profiling itself is modified as you play, how you interact with different objects, what things you do frequently, or not (e.g. checking your map).</p>
<p>In a game, when it comes to player interactions, emotions are one of the most useful indicators to a player. A character's emotions can convey anger, happiness, sadness, and frustration, and many games communicate this via complex and detailed narrative choices, characters voices, expressions, and overall presence. In many ways, emotions can contribute greatly to the atmosphere of a game, let alone their influence on how a player interacts, responds, or makes choices within an interaction. However, emotions play a more important role than simply conveying an atmosphere. They greatly influence the way that we make decisions. For example, a character is less likely to think if they haven't been experiencing a stressful event or challenge during gameplay, whereas if they have just narrowly escaped a boss and now have to make a fast decision (while a timer is ticking away) about whether to shoot a target or not, chances are there will be a very different thought process behind it. One of the best examples that I have experienced would be while playing Spec Ops: The Line (spoilers ahead). After having spent most of the game killing influxes of enemies, you finally reach a level where you have them cornered, but they then begin to "flee". Switching to an aerial view via helicopter, you can see that they appear to be converging into a corner with no way out. Perfect! Right? So, naturally, caught up in the moment, you spam the button to unleash fury onto them, trying to destroy every last one. However, that illuminated group of people isn't running. They're trapped—they're not fighting back. Well, needless to say, after being caught up in the moment to bring down hell onto your enemies, you have inadvertently failed your mission—to save the innocents. At this point, you're mentally drained and from here on out, in every dialogue option, you start to think more carefully about your choices and how they impact others—more so if you hadn't already.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Building better AI through psychology</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To make something inhuman (the AI) act human, you need to keep in mind that humans don't always act rationally—we can often be unpredictable. There are so many different things that humans consider before making choices (even in games) about what to do next. For example, they may take social information, such as the rank (status, level, etc.) of a player, into account before deciding to attack them. This is most likely to impact the narrative. In addition, players are likely to use mental shortcuts in their decision-making, which, depending on their own mental models, may lead to all kinds of unpredictable behavior. This can be further influenced by the game's environment and previous experiences. Therefore, how can you teach a computer to emulate, let alone respond in a believable way?</p>
<p>Developers need to design AI, and in doing so they also need to consider the psychology behind it. For example, should the AI respond to a player the way that he/she may be expecting (like that of a normal human being)? Perhaps the developer has created a fantasy where conventions exist and therefore the AI must respond accordingly (which may be out of the conventions of reality). In all cases, there are always points related to the psychology of the player, which the developer needs to keep in mind for the design of AI behavior. Therefore, as a developer, you need to consider <em>how</em> the AI interacts with the game environment in a convincing way. You need to make the AI aware of its environment, confine to the game's conventions, and respond/behave accordingly. Having the player trigger the AI by walking into a collision box to trigger an immediate response is a sure way to break the immersion. The AI needs to consider its current situation and be contextually aware. </p>
<p>Another consideration is the kinds of relationships that players are likely to form with <strong>non-player characters</strong> (<strong>NPCs</strong>). In games where there is a dynamic and branching narrative that the player influences, the idea is that you want players to feel connected to the game—to the characters within it. Ultimately, you want players to "feel" for the other characters and how do you do that, that is, with a convincing AI that was developed to connect with the human psyche. This can be done in such a way that it begins to feel like an interactive Turing test. At this point, you can see that there are at least several ways that you can use psychology to influence the design of AI.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In addition to branching narratives, another important aspect is the ability to incorporate emotion into the AI's interaction with the player. For example, if a player is interacting with different NPCs in a negative way, then this will influence the way that the AI will respond. This isn't necessarily in terms of narrative, but also in terms of attitude toward the player. For example, an NPC, in the beginning, may be willing to help you—perhaps even offer you a discounted rate during a trade. However, based on your relationships with other NPCs (e.g. negative attitudes), your actions may inevitably influence the attitudes of NPCs that you haven't behaved in the same way toward (e.g. those with a previously positive attitude toward you).</p>
<p>The irony is all of this is that to make AI believable is to make it imperfect. Humans are not perfect—we are far from it in many cases—so AI should be as well. For example, if an AI is chasing a player—even shooting at them—it doesn't make sense for the AI to hit the player with every bullet, just like human players; it would be reasonable that the AI misses. It should be a situation where the AI <em>barely</em> wins/loses. In this way, even if it is, to some level, a false sense of security for the player, it makes them feel like he/she is achieving something. It far outweighs a "God mode" scenario where the player can destroy everything with minimal effort or, in contrast, where he/she struggles to move forward because the AI is simply too powerful. Of course, this balance can be influenced depending on the difficulty setting that the player has set. By doing this, you're able to contribute to the player's immersion, that is, to make the game environment believable and that the player is interacting with another "person" rather than just a scripted character within a game.</p>
<p>Along the same lines of "believability" is the reaction time of AI. Just as much as you don't want to make them more powerful than the abilities that a player possesses, they too need to react with the same speed in terms of processing events as a player would. For example, players (a.k.a. humans) have an average reaction time of 0.2 seconds (vision) and 0.15 seconds (audio) (<a href="http://www.humanbenchmark.com">www.humanbenchmark.com</a>). What this means is that if we were to stand inside of a room, if another person was to open the door, it would take us 0.2/0.15 seconds to react to it, whether that is to turn our head to see who is at the door or to block the door from opening or even hide. Therefore, AI needs to behave the same, albeit handicapped, in terms of reaction time in order to avoid having an advantage to that of a human player. However, this extends to many other things, such as comprehending an event (e.g. was the explosion a bomb or a car backfiring?) and then responding (e.g. look for enemies, ignore, investigate). Keep in mind that for each of these types of events, the necessary reaction times <em>and</em> responses need to be implemented.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>By using psychology to drive the design of AI, we have a framework that helps us create believable narratives, characters, and environments so that we can create more immersive game environments. In addition, the consideration of psychology doesn't specifically relate to the design of AI—we can build upon this in terms of in-game events. For example, NPCs that move around the environment may have their own stories, their own "psychology", that drives their movement and even their interaction with the player. For example, NPC characters may encounter each other, some sort of altercation occurs, and as a result, this impacts the player's future interaction with them. This is likely to occur if there are characters within the game that the player can interact with and either does (but in a particular way) or does not interact with at all, which can influence the AI's interaction with the player at later parts within the game experience. Randomization is another aspect that can help improve the realness of AI within a game environment. Of course, to some extent, NPCs are likely to follow the same path when they walk, especially in a situation where there are guards protecting an area. However, every now and then, allowing the NPC to deviate on their path, perhaps to go around the front of a fountain instead of behind it, can all contribute to the authenticity of the environment.</p>
<p>Lastly, before we wrap up this chapter, <strong><em>testing</em></strong> your AI is essential to its success. Just like how human behavior is unpredictable, so can the behavior of your AI. This is particularly prevalent when it comes to pathfinding. For example, when a player is supposed to follow a path, but should another NPC cross it, or even the player, it may result in the AI acting in a strange way. As a result, it may break the immersion of the player or worse, disrupt the game mechanics and/or balance because of a glitch.</p>
<p>As we reach the end of this chapter, one piece of advice that I can recommend to you is that even though you don't need to get a degree in psychology to create convincing AI, it helps if you truly want to create AI that connects to your players on a deeper level.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence on its own is not enough to "genuinely" connect with players. More complicated and elaborated ways are necessary for the technology to align with us in more intimate ways. Therefore, machine learning provides us with a body of knowledge that can be used to find out what users like, don't like, to track their interactions and behavior, and adapt systems accordingly—of which includes instructing the AI on what to do next. Simply put, machine learning is a sub-domain of AI. This is very important to remember because, in many cases, people often confuse not only the definition of AI and machine learning, but also what they achieve. Machine learning allows a system to autonomously learn from data rather than the developer providing the data—or <em>hardcoding</em> it into the interaction.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>One last thing to keep in mind before considering AI and psychology is not to overestimate what either is capable of. Each have their limits, and we have limited (albeit growing) knowledge of their respective domains and how they can used together. Therefore, make sure that you do your research when you consider using them as part of your own project.</p>

<p>There are instances where you might and can use AI in games, but in these cases, it will differ from instances when you will use machine learning. However, it is very important to know the difference between the two, as we have already discussed, but also to know the differences in terms of their application and implementation within a game context.</p>

<p>Game designers might consider the use of AI within a game if there is a need to have autonomous characters. For example, if you want to have enemies that run around chasing the player if he/she shoots at them or to detect the player if he/she gets too close.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the use of machine learning in games would require a slightly different approach and set of considerations. Like our example with AI, you may implement machine learning in a game environment if you want the game to "learn" the habits of a player.</p>

<p>A practical use of AI for gameplay is the ability to adapt a game's environment (and all that it contains) in ways that respond to a player's input. For example, if players are constantly failing at a certain part of a level, then the player spawns closer to it or the enemies become easier to attack. This process of adapting difficulty is known as dynamic difficulty adjustment, and it is great because it allow players to progress through a game where some parts are particularly more challenging than others. The game Crash Bandicoot is an excellent example of a game that implements this mechanic, and allows you to enjoy a challenging yet playable game experience.</p>

<p>Well, pretty much everything!</p>
<p>Despite the many pages within this book, we have only just scratched the surface of this wonderful topic of AI in games. How many times did I say in this book "<em>Unfortunately, this [insert topic] is outside the scope of this book</em>"? Too many to remember. This is just for the built-in AI Framework of Unreal (for instance, we haven't covered how to properly extend Generators and Tests for EQS, or how to create a custom AI Sense). However, I strongly believe that this book gave you some solid foundation to iterate upon and keep learning the Unreal AI Framework. Hopefully, you will be able to use this book as a reference for your work in Unreal.</p>
<p>As much as I hope that this book has been helpful to set the first stone, the intention of this section is to indicate that the path is made of thousands of stones. By randomly pointing toward the main ones, I hope to inspire you to keep going on this path. We will discuss some of these "stones" in more detail in the following sections.</p>

<p>In <a href="fe5b7602-fcb4-4d39-bf8c-e1742909205a.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Navigation</em>, we explored the navigation system that comes within Unreal. However, we didn't talk about motion, which comes down in the AI schema we presented in <a href="42076317-364e-4824-a8b7-cc2c418f021e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Making the First Steps in the World of AI</em>.</p>
<p>Motion deals with the acceleration and velocity of the character, including the avoidance of obstacles and other agents. Of course, we looked at <em>avoidance</em> in <a href="c1359fa6-3bdf-4f0d-8a0c-98c35f885167.xhtml">Chapter 7</a><em>, Crowds</em>, and acceleration and low-level movement is within the Movement components in Unreal. However, there is a whole part about <em>steering behaviors</em> that deals with controlling the acceleration of the agents to create more realistic behaviors, which we haven't explored.</p>

<p>Racing games are definitely a case on their own. In fact, we will need an AI that is able to perform Continuous Pathfinding (which is still an unresolved problem in its general form) and compete with different gameplay mechanics. Many other AI algorithms play a role there, such as those for balancing the game (e.g. creating a "virtual spring" among all the cars).</p>

<p>Sometimes, the world around the agent is not continuous, but discrete and potentially turn-based. As such, the agent cannot always use the algorithms that we have explored in this book. Game theory and the maths behind discrete games are important for many game applications, from turn-based games to the strategic allocation of resources for combat systems.</p>

<p>Even if, when you think about AI in games, agents are the first thing that comes to mind, a game might contain many other AI algorithms. Although learning techniques are not widely used in games due to the fact that they don't always lead to coherent results, and most of the time they are not required by the game, this topic starts to become appealing to the game industry.</p>

<p><strong>Procedural Content Generation</strong> (<strong>PCG</strong>) is another example of an AI algorithm that isn't tied to an agent, but rather it is the whole world in the game that generates content for the player. These techniques are used both by level designers to create worlds and artists to customize meshes or textures, but also at runtime, while the player is playing, to create an infinite world, usually in arcade games.</p>

<p>Search and optimization are fundamental tools for any AI Developer, since these are important techniques that are used widely in AI in general, but which might come in handy when working on AI systems for games. Although these techniques are not used in front of the player, they are used under the hood by the game engine.</p>

<p>Often, AI agents in video games are not alone, but they need to collaborate to achieve a common goal. Multi-Agent Systems are uncommon in video games because they are sometimes hard to implement, but if they're well-combined, they can achieve greatly realistic behaviors. For this reason, most of the time, the collaboration is faked, but this problem can be solved with Multi-Agent Systems, especially if the design of the game requires a more advanced interaction between agents. In addition, these systems are suitable to achieve realistic behaviors in online games with many agents, where computational power can be distributed on many machines.</p>

<p>This chapter explains the broader role of AI within the workflow of game development, and how it should be integrated with Game Design to get the best out of the different systems. The aim of this section is to introduce you to different common and less common situations in which an AI algorithm is more suitable than another. Moreover, this section will give you an insight into the relationship between AI and psychology, and how the former affects the latter. In fact, the end user of an AI system is the player, and how he/she feels comfortable or believes in an AI system is a crucial element.</p>

<p>If you are thirsty to learn more, I can completely understand. Finding good materials on the subject is hard, despite the community being very wild, friendly, and very nice.</p>
<p>For sure, the first place to look is the <strong><em>Official Documentation</em></strong> (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/">https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/</a>), which needs to be integrated with the <strong><em>Forum</em></strong> and <strong><em>Answerhub</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, participating in events is a great way to connect with people and share knowledge. Did you know that Unreal Engine has official meetups around all the globe? Check it out: <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/user-groups">https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/user-groups</a>.</p>
<p>Other events include <strong><em>Unreal Fest</em></strong>, <strong><em>GDC</em></strong>,<strong><em> </em></strong>and <strong><em>Gamescom</em></strong> (among many others).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If you are looking for more traditional resources instead, such as books and blogs, there are a few resources about Unreal Engine (especially related to AI in some way) that I found particularly useful. These are personal blogs, but they contain very useful information. I wish I could state them all, and maybe we should do a list, because there are great people around doing amazing stuff. These are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Tom Looman's blog</em></strong> (<a href="https://www.tomlooman.com/">https://www.tomlooman.com</a>): You can find a bit of everything, especially about C++. An interesting article is about <em>Utility AI</em> here: <a href="https://www.tomlooman.com/journey-into-utility-ai-ue4/">https://www.tomlooman.com/journey-into-utility-ai-ue4/</a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Orfeas Eleftheriou's blog</em></strong> <span>(</span><a href="https://orfeasel.com">https://orfeasel.com</a><span>): A rich blog about very interesting topics. What's particularly interesting is the article about how to extend the AI perception System, which can be found here: </span><a href="https://orfeasel.com/creating-custom-ai-senses/">https://orfeasel.com/creating-custom-ai-senses/</a><span>. Honestly, I was going to add a whole section to this book about extending the AI perception System, but unfortunately, I didn't have the time. I hope that this blog article can put you on the right path.</span></li>
<li><em><strong>Vikram Saran's blog</strong></em> <span>(</span><a href="https://www.vikram.codes">https://www.vikram.codes</a><span>): This is a small blog at the moment, but you can find some nice additional information about the</span> <em>Navigation System</em><span>.</span></li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">AI and philosophy</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Finally, I want to conclude this book with some thoughts about AI that you may find interesting.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The crucial questions to ask if we are considering the philosophical side of artificial intelligence are: how do minds work? Is it possible that machines act intelligently in the way people do? Can machines be conscious?</p>
<p class="mce-root">These simple questions have sparked a great deal of controversy over the past century (and they still do). The aim of this section is not to discuss them thoroughly, but to provide very general ideas about the interesting dialogue around these issues and to stimulate your interest in reading more literature on them.</p>
<p>Gödel's incompleteness theorem states that, for any formal axiomatic system, F, that's powerful enough to do arithmetic, it is possible to construct a sentence, G (F), with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>G (F) is a phrase of F, but cannot be proved within F</li>
<li>If F is coherent, then G (F) is true</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Some philosophers maintain that Gödel's theorem shows that machines are inferior to humans because they are formal systems that are limited by the theorem, while humans have no such limitation. Or do we?</p>
<p>It seems impossible to prove that humans are not subject to Gödel's theorem, because any rigorous proof would require a formalization of human talent declared non-formalizable, and would, therefore, be rejected.</p>
<p>Humans are known to be inconsistent in everyday reasoning, and this may leave us unable to prove our superiority.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The <em>weak AI hypothesis</em> implies that machines can act as if they are intelligent. In 1950, Alan Turing suggested that instead of asking if machines can think, we should ask ourselves if machines can pass a behavioral intelligence test, which has become known as the Turing test. The test makes a program have a conversation (via messages typed online) with an interrogator for five minutes. The interrogator must, therefore, guess whether the conversation is with a program or a person; the program passes the test if it deceives the interrogator 30% of the time. Turing speculated that by the year 2000, a computer could be programmed well enough to pass the test.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Today, internet chatbots like Natachata have repeatedly deceived their correspondents, and the Cyberlover chatbot can cause people to disclose sufficient personal information that their identity can be stolen.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The <em>strong AI hypothesis</em>, on the other hand, claims that machines can really think, not just simulate thought.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Can machines be aware of their mental states and actions? Can they really feel emotions?<br/>
Turing himself opposed these questions, arguing that in ordinary life, we never have direct evidence of the internal mental states of other humans. Do the other humans that surround us think, or are they simulating?</p>
<p class="mce-root">Can we imagine a future time when realistic conversations with machines are the order of the day, and it becomes customary not to make linguistic distinctions between real and simulated thinking? Turing thought that these problems would eventually disappear by themselves once the machines reached a certain level of sophistication, thus dissolving the difference between strong and weak AI.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Another important issue is consciousness, which is often divided into aspects of understanding and self-awareness.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Turing admitted that the question of conscience was difficult, but denied that it was important for artificial intelligence. Human beings can create thinking machines, but whether consciousness arises it is far beyond our current knowledge.</p>
<p class="mce-root">An important debate concerns the physical composition of minds and bodies and the separation between them.</p>
<p class="mce-root">How can the mind control the body if the two are really separate?</p>
<p class="mce-root">A theory called <em>physicalism</em> asserts that the mind is not separate from the body, but it is not yet necessary to explain how the biochemical processes in our mind can generate mental states (such as fear or anger) and emotions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The theory of functionalism holds that a mental state is an intermediate causal condition between input and output. Artificial intelligence could have the same mental states as a human being in the right conditions. The basic assumption is that there is a level of abstraction, below which the specific implementation does not matter.</p>
<p class="mce-root">A strong challenge to functionalism is posed by <em>biological naturalism</em>, according to which mental states are high-level characteristics that emerge from low-level physical processes in neurons.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The Chinese Room is a thought experiment that demonstrates this vision. It consists of a human, understanding only the English language, equipped with an English grammar book, and several piles of sheets. The system is inside a room with a small opening.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Undecipherable symbols appear on paper through the opening. The symbols are checked by the human in the rules book and instructions are followed. These instructions may include writing symbols on new sheets of paper, looking for symbols in the stacks, reordering the stacks, etc. At the end, the instructions will cause one or more symbols to be transcribed on a piece of paper that is returned to the outside world.</p>
<p class="mce-root">From the outside, we see a system that is taking the input in Chinese sentences and generates answers in Chinese that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Does the Chinese room system speak Chinese? At what level does the interpretation of the language occur? Does it really happen?</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><br/>

<p class="mce-root">I will conclude with some brief ethical considerations. Okay, we might be able to create intelligence... but should we? Do we have moral responsibilities?</p>
<p class="mce-root">Many engineers and scientists have addressed ethical considerations on the technologies they were dealing with. Just think of nuclear fission, or even cars, which cause a huge number of deaths each year.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The AI raises many questions, ranging from the possibility that people lose their jobs to the fear of losing our privileged place on Earth, from military uses of robots as tools of death to moral questions about the relationships between human beings and artificial beings. But probably the most common ethical objections to AI concern the possibility that the advent of artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Countless science fiction films have been produced by Hollywood studios on cyborgs or smart networks that go to war with humans. More recently, the debate has shifted to different aspects, such as autonomous cars causing accidents that could kill occupants, or a missile defense system that could mistakenly launch a counterattack, leading to the death of billions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The correct way to mitigate these risks is to include the controls in these systems so that a single error does not spread to unplanned consequences.</p>
<p class="mce-root">But the rules to be imposed on AI (starting from Asimov's laws for robots) are probably the core of ethical implications. We must be very careful about what we ask!</p>
<p class="mce-root">Humans sometimes use their intelligence in aggressive ways because of natural selection. The machines we build must not be intrinsically aggressive, unless they emerge as the end product of a mechanism that encourages aggressive behavior.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The most important risk is the evolution of AI that leads to unexpected behavior. The desire not to harm humans can be designed from the beginning, but engineers should recognize that their designs might be imperfect and that the system will learn and evolve over time. So, the real challenge is to implement a project for evolving artificial intelligence systems within a system of checks and balances and to giv e the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.</p>
