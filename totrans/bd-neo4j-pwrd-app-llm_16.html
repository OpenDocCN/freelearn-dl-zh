    <h1 id="_idParaDest-196" class="chapterTitle">Epilogue</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We have looked at quite a few topics and explored how to build intelligent applications. Now, we will revisit what we learned in the earlier chapters and look at the next steps in our journey. We will review how Neo4j is best suited to build knowledge graphs and how it integrates with the GenAI ecosystem to build intelligent search and recommendation applications with ease. We will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">The combined power of GenAI and Neo4j</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Beyond the book: exploring advanced techniques and resources for continued learning</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Closing remarks</li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-197" class="heading-1">The combined power of GenAI and Neo4j</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapters 1–3</em>, we looked <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>at how GenAI and the evolution of LLMs came into the picture and how they jumpstarted technology, enabling natural interactions and ease of use. We also looked at how these same capabilities, because of the way they work, can provide information that is believable but might actually be false, as well as information that might not exist, which is referred to as hallucinations. We looked at how RAG can help with reducing these hallucinations.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We<a id="_idTextAnchor119"/> looked into<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> knowledge graphs and how we can model them effectively to participate in RAG flows, called GraphRAG approaches. GraphRAG can be more effective and accurate than traditional RAG by integrating evolving knowledge graphs, which can ground LLMs with ease of use.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-198" class="heading-2">GraphRAG for search applications</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapters 4–6</em>, we embarked on a hands-on journey to build a powerful and intelligent search <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>experience using a movie knowledge graph. Starting with structured data, we modeled and constructed the graph using Python and enriched it with vector embeddings generated through the Haystack framework. These embeddings, stored directly in the graph, helped us achieve a similarity search for our GraphRAG pipeline.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Using vector search with the power of knowledge graphs, we created a hybrid retrieval system capable of answering not just simple keyword queries but also complex questions that might require multi-hop traversal to retrieve results. Through the integration of LLMs and GraphRAG, we moved on to intelligent search, which is capable of both document retrieval and context-aware understanding.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">These chapters demonstrated the real-world potential of combining structured knowledge from graphs with the expressive power of LLMs.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-199" class="heading-2">GraphRAG for recommendations</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapters 7–10</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>looked at building a recommendations application by leveraging GraphRAG. We leveraged Langchain4J and Spring AI to understand how we can build GraphRAG applications using Java and the Spring framework. We followed numerous steps to build an intelligent recommendation application. The first one was building a knowledge graph by loading H&amp;M customer transaction data. The next important step was to augment the graph by adding seasonal relationships, which helped consume the data in a more granular fashion. We then used these seasonal relationships as part of the GraphRAG flow to generate a summary of customer purchases for a given season, along with embeddings to enrich the graph with more context. These embeddings and graph data science algorithms captured relationships between similar customers, with the help of the KNN algorithm. Upon<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> creating similarity relationships, community detection algorithms were utilized to group the customers into communities to provide better recommendations. We also looked at why this pipeline gives us better recommendations than relying on a simple vector search itself.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When we built this application, we used GraphRAG not to generate text for end user consumption but to enrich the knowledge graph, to provide better recommendations. This showed how LLMs can play a part not just as chatbots but also in enriching the data to understand it better and in a new light.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-200" class="heading-2">Choosing your cloud platform</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Chapters 11–12</em> focused <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>on various available cloud services. We drew a detailed comparison to help you select a cloud for your GenAI applications. In the last chapter, we demonstrated how to deploy your application to the Google Cloud.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next up, we will talk about how we can go beyond what we have discussed in this book.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-201" class="heading-1">Beyond the book: exploring resources for continued learning</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">While we <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>have discussed, with simple examples, the importance of graph data modeling and looked at two specific graph data model examples, it would be prudent to understand how Neo4j helps in building better graphs and how its architecture can assist with building knowledge graphs in a scalable manner. Neo4j provides the following resources to learn more about Neo4j, knowledge graphs, and GraphRAG implementations:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Neo4j Graph Academy</strong>: You can find Neo4j Graph Academy at <span class="url">https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/</span>. This contains a wealth of resources to understand Neo4j concepts and build knowledge graphs. For example, the course at <span class="url">https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-workshop-graphrag/</span> provides an easy-to-follow workshop to understand GraphRAG principles.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Neo4j GraphRAG Python package</strong>: Neo4j provides a simple-to-use GraphRAG Python package.

    </ul>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s head over to the closing remarks.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-202" class="heading-1">Closing remarks</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We have looked at various aspects of emerging LLM frameworks and how we can build better solutions using these frameworks. While this technology is exciting and opening new doors for how we look at and solve problems, it is still in its nascent stages. It requires a lot of processing power and may not have the <strong class="keyWord">service-level agreement (SLA)</strong> response times we might be looking for. While we might get excited about solving all the problems using this approach, it’s important to evaluate whether trying to solve a given problem really needs to leverage these technologies or whether we can solve them more reasonably and effectively. For example, many people are <span id="page4-15" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="270" epub:type="pagebreak"/>excited about LLM capabilities and trying to generate data models (be it graphs, SQL, or other) by describing a problem. This can be a double-edged sword. If we are not familiar with the data we are working with, we may not be able to validate the model generated. If we are very familiar with the data, we might have better context and nuances of the data that LLMs might be missing. So, we might not benefit as much when we try to solve the problems in this manner. So, keep in mind that this might be a surgical knife to solve the problems effectively, not an axe, so use it effectively.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">While this book concludes here, your journey does not have to. Armed with the foundational knowledge, tools, and working examples, you are now ready to experiment, expand, and elevate your own GenAI solutions. Whether you are building smart assistants, contextual search engines, or personalized recommender systems, the future of intelligent applications is now in your hands.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Keep building. Keep exploring. And most importantly, keep connecting ideas, data, and people through the power of knowledge graphs and generative AI.</p>&#13;
