			<h1 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Automatic Multi-Step Reasoning and Tool Use</h1>
			<p>Multi-step reasoning and tool use in LLMs involve the model’s ability to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and leverage external resources or APIs to accomplish these tasks. This capability significantly extends the problem-solving potential of LLMs, allowing them to tackle more complex, real-world scenarios. Its key characteristics include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task decomposition</strong>: This refers to the model’s ability to take a complex input or <a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/>goal and divide it into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that can be solved sequentially or hierarchically. Instead of trying to solve an entire problem in one step, the model creates a structured plan or sequence of reasoning steps that progressively leads to a solution. This process mimics the way humans often approach complex problems by identifying dependencies, sequencing actions, and breaking large goals into intermediate objectives. Techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting explicitly encourage this behavior by prompting the model to articulate each reasoning step before arriving at <span class="No-Break">an answer.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External tools</strong>: The capabilities of LLMs can be enhanced by integrating additional <a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/>resources, such as databases, APIs, or specialized services, that LLMs cannot access directly due to limitations in their training environment. These tools enable the LLMs to interact with real-time data, perform specific tasks beyond their built-in knowledge, or offer enhanced functionalities such as web browsing, file handling, or executing external scripts. For example, an LLM can use an external tool to query up-to-date weather data, retrieve specific information from a live API, or run computations that require specialized algorithms. This integration allows LLMs to offer more dynamic, relevant, and specialized responses, particularly for applications requiring real-time information or complex <span class="No-Break">multi-step processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reasoning about tool applicability</strong>: This involves the model’s judgment in recognizing <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/>when an external capability is required to solve a particular sub-task. The model must assess the nature of the sub-task and determine whether internal reasoning suffices or whether delegating part of the task to a tool would yield better or even <span class="No-Break">necessary results.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tool selection and invocation</strong>: This refers to the model’s ability to identify which tool <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/>is appropriate for a given sub-task and to formulate the correct input to trigger its use. This requires the model to understand the functionality and input requirements of each available tool and to match these against the demands of the current step in the reasoning process. For example, if the task requires accessing up-to-date weather information, the model must choose a weather API and generate a syntactically correct and semantically relevant query to that API. This phase includes formatting inputs, calling the tool, and ensuring that the request aligns with both the current problem context and the <span class="No-Break">tool’s capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration of tool outputs</strong>: This describes the model’s capability to interpret <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>the results returned by the external tool and incorporate them into the ongoing reasoning process. After a tool is invoked and responds with data—such as a numerical value, a structured object, or a text snippet—the model must parse the result, extract relevant elements, and update its understanding or intermediate outputs accordingly. This step often involves interpreting heterogeneous output formats, managing type mismatches, and maintaining continuity in the reasoning chain. Effective integration ensures that tool use is not isolated but meaningfully contributes to solving the <span class="No-Break">broader task.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative problem solving</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/>refers to the model’s recursive application of the previous stages—decomposition, tool reasoning, selection, invocation, and integration—in a loop until the task is resolved or further steps become unproductive. The model continuously reassesses its progress, determines whether additional sub-tasks remain, and decides whether further tool use is necessary. This iterative behavior <a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/>enables the model to handle tasks with dynamic structure, uncertainty, or errors from prior steps by adjusting the plan or refining previous actions. In agent-based architectures, this process may be explicitly managed by a planner or controller, while in prompt-based settings, it often emerges through recursive self-queries and <span class="No-Break">prompt augmentation.</span></li>

			<p>In this chapter, we’ll delve into advanced techniques for enabling LLMs to perform complex multi-step reasoning and utilize <span class="No-Break">external tools.</span></p>

			<p>To enable LLMs to use external tools such as search, calculations, API calls, and so on, we need to <a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/>create an interface between the model and the tools. Here’s a <span class="No-Break">simple implementation:</span></p>
			<ol>

			<p>This <strong class="source-inline">ToolKit</strong> class provides an interface for the LLM to interact with external tools, simulating API calls and data <span class="No-Break">processing tasks.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Implementing automatic tool selection and use</h1>
			<p>To enable <a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/>LLMs to automatically select and use tools, we can create a system that interprets the model’s output and executes the appropriate tools. Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we define a function, <strong class="source-inline">auto_tool_use</strong>, that uses a pre-trained language model and tokenizer from Hugging Face’s Transformers library to decompose a task into executable steps using a prompt, parses the decomposition into steps, executes tools as needed using a toolkit, and collects <span class="No-Break">the results:</span><pre class="source-code">
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
def auto_tool_use(model, tokenizer, task, toolkit):
    # Generate task decomposition
    decomposition_prompt = task_decomposition_prompt(
        task, toolkit.tools.keys()
    )
    inputs = tokenizer(decomposition_prompt,
        return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs, max_length=1000, num_return_sequences=1
    )
    decomposition = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0],
        skip_special_tokens=True)
    # Parse decomposition and execute tools
    steps = parse_steps(decomposition)
    results = []
    for step in steps:
        if step['tool']:
            result = toolkit.use_tool(step['tool'],
                *step['args'])
        else:
            result = f"Reasoning: {step['reasoning']}"
        results.append(result)</pre></li>				<li>Then we <a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/>generate a final report. The generated report contains the task description, a breakdown of each step along with its result, and a concluding summary. The model uses the provided steps and results to generate a more cohesive and comprehensive narrative of <span class="No-Break">the task:</span><pre class="source-code">
    report_prompt = f"Task: {task}\n\nSteps and Results:\n"
    for i, (step, result) in enumerate(zip(steps, results), 1):

        inputs, max_length=1500, num_return_sequences=1
    )
    report = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0],
        skip_special_tokens=True)
    return report</pre></li>				<li>Then, we implement <a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/>logic to parse the decomposition into structured steps. This is a simplified <span class="No-Break">placeholder implementation:</span><pre class="source-code">
def parse_steps(decomposition):

			<p>The first three sections of this chapter laid the groundwork by covering prompt design, integrating external tools, and implementing automatic tool selection to enhance AI functionality.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Complex problem solving</h1>
			<p>Multi-step <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>reasoning and tool use can be applied to various complex problem-solving scenarios. Here’s an example of how to use this approach for <span class="No-Break">market analysis:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
def market_analysis(model, tokenizer, toolkit, product_name):

# Example usage

The prompt requests a multi-part analysis—covering competitors, sentiment analysis of customer feedback, and visualization of market trends—targeted to the specific <strong class="source-inline">product_name</strong> supplied. This design leverages the model and toolkit to produce a consolidated report without manual intervention, enabling a consistent and repeatable approach to product market research through <span class="No-Break">prompt-driven execution.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Evaluating multi-step reasoning and tool use</h1>
			<p>To assess the effectiveness of multi-step reasoning and tool use, we need to evaluate both <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>the process and the outcome. Here’s a simple <span class="No-Break">evaluation framework:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/>powerful, multi-step reasoning and tool use in LLMs face <span class="No-Break">several challenges:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tool selection accuracy</strong>: Ensure LLMs choose the most appropriate tools for <span class="No-Break">each task</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Error propagation</strong>: Mitigate the impact of errors in the early steps of the reasoning process; keep in mind that error propagation across multiple steps can be a major risk in complex tool chains if not <span class="No-Break">mitigated early</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Manage the complexity of integrating a large number of <span class="No-Break">diverse tools</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptability</strong>: Enable LLMs to work with new, unseen tools <span class="No-Break">without retraining</span></li>

			<p>We can identify the following three promising research areas for overcoming the challenges from some research conducted by <span class="No-Break">AI/ML communities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced tool learning and discovery</strong>: Future LLMs will be able to dynamically learn about and integrate new tools without explicit programming. This involves mechanisms for understanding tool documentation and API specifications and even experimenting with tools to infer their functionality. This will allow LLMs to adapt to a constantly evolving landscape of software and services, expanding their capabilities beyond a fixed set of pre-defined tools. This will involve techniques such as meta-learning, reinforcement learning from tool interactions, and semantic understanding of tool <span class="No-Break">descriptions (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126"><span class="No-Break">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Robust and adaptive reasoning with uncertainty</strong>: Future LLMs will incorporate probabilistic models to handle uncertainty in multi-step tasks. This means <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>assigning probabilities to different reasoning paths, outcomes, and tool effectiveness. Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo simulations, and other probabilistic techniques will be integrated into the reasoning process. This will enable LLMs to make more robust decisions in complex scenarios with incomplete or noisy information and to better manage the inherent uncertainty of real-world problems. LLMs will be better equipped to handle unexpected situations, recover from errors, and provide more reliable solutions when faced with <span class="No-Break">ambiguity (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406"><span class="No-Break">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Human-in-the-loop multi-step reasoning with explainability</strong>: Future systems will involve closer collaboration between humans and LLMs in multi-step problem solving. This means creating interfaces that allow humans to understand the LLM’s reasoning process, provide guidance, correct errors, and work together on complex tasks. Explainability will be key, with LLMs able to articulate their reasoning steps, justify tool choices, and present alternative solution paths. This will foster trust and allow for more effective human-AI collaboration, especially in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research. This could involve visualizations of reasoning graphs, natural language explanations, and interactive debugging <span class="No-Break">tools: </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/guidance-for-developing-with-large-language-models-llms/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/guidance-for-developing-with-larg<span id="_idTextAnchor363"/>e-language-models-llms/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p>Automatic multi-step reasoning and tool use significantly expand the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to tackle complex, <span class="No-Break">real-world tasks.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to design prompts for complex task decomposition and implement systems that allow LLMs to interact with external tools and APIs. We looked at strategies for automatic tool selection and use and explored applications in complex problem-solving scenarios.

			<p>We conclude this book by examining techniques that enhance LLMs with external knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. You will learn how to design retrieval systems that efficiently access relevant information, integrate structured knowledge into model outputs, and leverage graph-based retrieval to enrich responses with contextual relationships. Advanced RAG patterns, such as iterative and adaptive retrieval, will be explored, helping you create models capable of dynamic knowledge integration. We also discuss evaluation methodologies to measure retrieval quality and effectiveness. The final chapter introduces agentic patterns, enabling you to build autonomous systems that combine reasoning, planning, and decision-making.
