- en: In the second part of the book, we move from concepts to hands-on implementation.
    We begin by modeling a real-world dataset—movies—into a well-structured Neo4j
    knowledge graph, preparing it for intelligent querying. Then, we integrate the
    Haystack framework with Neo4j to enable powerful, hybrid search experiences that
    combine semantic understanding with graph-based context. The final chapter takes
    this further by exploring advanced capabilities such as multi-hop reasoning and
    context-aware search, showcasing how to unlock deeper insights from your knowledge
    graph.
