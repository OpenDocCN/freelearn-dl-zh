    documents into high-dimensional vector representations. By computing similarity
    scores, such as the dot product between the query vector and document vectors,
    the model evaluates the relevance of each document to the query. The documents
    are then ranked based on their similarity scores, with the most relevant ones
    appearing at the top. This process highlights the power of vector-based retrieval
    in effectively identifying contextually relevant information from a diverse set

- en: The BM25 algorithm ranks documents based on their relevance to a query. It relies
    on the term frequency (how often a keyword appears in a document) and document
    length, applying a probabilistic scoring function to evaluate relevance. Unlike
    vector similarity search, which represents both queries and documents as dense
    numerical vectors in high-dimensional space and measures similarity using mathematical
    functions such as the dot product, BM25 operates directly on discrete word matches.
    This means BM25 is efficient and interpretable but can struggle with semantic
    relationships, as it cannot recognize synonyms or contextual meanings. In contrast,
    vector similarity search, such as DPR, excels in identifying conceptual similarities
    even when exact keywords differ, making it more suitable for tasks requiring deep
    semantic understanding. This snippet illustrates BM25’s utility for straightforward
    keyword-matching tasks where efficiency and explainability are critical.

- en: In this chapter, we deep-dived into the world of RAG models. We started by understanding
    the core principles of RAG and how they differ from traditional generative AI
    models. This foundational knowledge is crucial as it sets the stage for appreciating
    the enhanced capabilities that RAG brings to the table.

- en: Next, we took a closer look at the architecture of RAG models, deconstructing
    their components through detailed code examples. By examining the encoder, retriever,
    and decoder, you gained insights into the inner workings of these models and how
    they integrate retrieved information to produce more contextually relevant and
    coherent outputs.

    techniques help RAG effectively leverage external knowledge sources to improve
    the quality of a generated text. This is particularly useful for applications
    requiring high accuracy and context awareness. You also learned how to a simple
    RAG model using popular libraries such as Transformers and Hugging Face.

    Face这样的流行库构建一个简单的RAG模型。

    we will build on this foundation. You will learn about graph data modeling and
    how to create knowledge graphs with Neo4j.
