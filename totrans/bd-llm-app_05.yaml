- en: This chapter kickstarts the hands-on portions of this book, focusing on how
    we can **leverage large language models** (**LLMs**) to build powerful AI applications.
    In fact, LLMs have introduced a whole new paradigm in software development, paving
    the way for new families of applications that have the peculiarity of making the
    communication between the user and the machine smooth and conversational. Plus,
    those models enhanced existing applications, such as chatbots and recommendation
    systems, with their unique reasoning capabilities.

- en: Developing LLM-powered applications is becoming a key factor for enterprises
    to keep themselves competitive in the market, and this leads to the spreading
    of new libraries and frameworks that make it easier to embed LLMs within applications.
    Some examples are Semantic Kernel, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and LangChain. In this
    chapter, we are going to cover LangChain and use its modules to build hands-on
    examples. By the end of this chapter, you will have the technical foundations
    to start developing your LLM-powered applications using LangChain and open-source
    Hugging Face models.

    more general and flexible than a vector store. A retriever can use any method
    to find relevant documents, while a vector store relies on embeddings and similarity
    metrics. A retriever can also use different sources of documents, such as web
    pages, databases, or files, while a vector store needs to store the data itself.

    project directory and list your sensitive information as key-value pairs: in our
    scenario, we will have `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="your_user_access_token"`. This
    file should be added to your project’s `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.'

    application, both proprietary and open source. However, the idea is that you can
    use the model you prefer by simply initializing it as the main LLM and running
    the code as it is, simply changing the LangChain LLM integration. This is one
    of the main advantages of LLM-powered applications since you don’t have to change
    the whole code to adapt to different LLMs.
