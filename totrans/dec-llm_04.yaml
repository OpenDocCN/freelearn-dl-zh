- en: Transfer learning is the process of taking a pre-trained model that’s been trained
    on a large dataset (often a general one) and adapting it to a new, typically related
    task. The idea is to leverage the knowledge the model has already acquired, such
    as understanding language structures or recognizing objects in images, and apply
    it to a new problem with less data available. In NLP, transfer learning has revolutionized
    the way models are developed. Previously, most NLP tasks required a model to be
    built from scratch, a process that involved extensive data collection and training
    time. With transfer learning, you can take a pre-trained model and adapt it to
    a new task with relatively little data.

    the order and complexity of training data, this approach not only makes the training
    process more efficient but also enhances the performance and generalization capabilities
    of the models. Such benefits are particularly important as LLMs are increasingly
    being deployed in diverse and complex real-world scenarios, where adaptability
    and robustness are key to success.

    to learn continuously from a stream of data, acquiring, retaining, and transferring
    knowledge across tasks over time. The primary challenge these models address is
    avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when a model learns a new task
    at the expense of previously learned tasks.
