<h3 class="calibre8"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.47.1">Purpose – paving the way for progress</span></h3>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.48.1">In the initial days of AI and ML, the models</span><a id="_idIndexMarker977" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.49.1"> were rudimentary—not due to a lack of imagination or intent, but because of restrictive computational boundaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.49.2">Tasks that we now consider basic, such as simple pattern recognitions, were significant undertakings, as they demanded great algorithmic sophistication to allow for low complexity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.49.3">In computer science classes, we were taught that an algorithm with complexity beyond linear has poor sustainability and </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.50.1">impractical scalability.</span></span></p>

<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.226.1">Enhancing domain expertise</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.227.1">: While niche datasets cater to domain specificity, their size can often be restrictive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.227.2">Augmented datasets can bridge this gap, artificially expanding domain-specific datasets, thereby offering both depth and breadth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.227.3">For instance, rare medical conditions that may have limited real-world data can be augmented to train </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.228.1">robust models.</span></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.229.1">Diversity amplification</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.230.1">: The struggle to capture the myriad nuances of global languages and cultures can be significantly alleviated by augmentation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.230.2">Techniques such as back-translation or synonym replacement can introduce linguistic diversity, and context-based modifications can simulate cultural nuances, thus driving models toward true </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.231.1">global comprehension.</span></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.232.1">Bias rectification</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.233.1">: One of the groundbreaking applications of data augmentation lies in its potential to balance out biases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.233.2">By recognizing underrepresented voices or</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1005" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.234.1"> themes in a dataset, augmentation can artificially boost them, ensuring a more balanced representation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.234.2">Techniques such as adversarial training, where models are deliberately presented with challenging or contradictory data, can be employed to iron </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.235.1">out biases.</span></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.236.1">Regulatory compliance</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.237.1">: In a world tightening its data regulatory strings, augmented datasets offer a valuable advantage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.237.2">Moreover, techniques can be designed to ensure that augmented data adheres to privacy norms, thus giving models ample training data without trespassing regulatory boundaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.237.3">For instance, think about our healthcare code example, where we implemented an in-house search engine that finds medical records based on a physician’s query. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.237.4">In order to provide it with a database, we generated mocked medical records by </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.238.1">prompting ChatGPT.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.239.1">Nonetheless, while augmented datasets offer innovative solutions to many data-related challenges, they aren’t without shortcomings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.239.2">In principle, over-reliance on augmentation can lead to models that are adept at recognizing artificial patterns but fail with real-world variability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.239.3">There’s also the risk of inadvertently amplifying biases if the original datasets had unaccounted skews. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.239.4">Furthermore, not all augmentation techniques are universally applicable; what works for one dataset might distort another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.239.5">Lastly, there’s the ethical debate around creating synthetic data, especially in sensitive fields, where the distinction between real and augmented could blur </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.240.1">essential truths.</span></span></p>

<li class="calibre15"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.415.1">As the user controls the data that the LLM has access to, one can develop schema that are dedicated to </span><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.416.1">monitoring the correctness of the results</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.417.1">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.417.2">This then reduces hallucinations and mistakes, which are two of the key shortcomings for LLMs, thus making RAGs a </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.418.1">potential solution.</span></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.419.1">RAGs are very </span><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.420.1">simple and easy to spin up</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.421.1">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.421.2">One could put together a RAG for free using public code and using as little storage as you might have on your laptop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.421.3">Conceptually, in its basic form, an RAG is a set of connections between the pre-existing computation and </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.422.1">data resources.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="calibre135"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.423.1">Challenges of RAGs</span></h4>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.424.1">With RAGs being a new technology that is built on LLMs, which is another new technology, this presents </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.425.1">various challenges.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.426.1">One such challenge is the choice of the structure design of retrieved data, which is significant to the functionality of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1031" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.1"> RAG. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.2">It is common practice to process the raw data ahead of time, in bulk, so that when the LLM is used, the data are already in a format that lends itself to the retrieval process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.3">As such, this offline process has a complexity of O(1) when measured as a function of the number of retrievals or prompts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.4">Vector databases are emerging as the go-to design for this purpose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.5">They are numerical databases that aim to capture a minimal representation of the data in a format that is similar and sometimes identical to the format that the LLM employs when it processes a prompt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.6">This format is the embeddings that we have covered throughout the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.7">It should be added that embeddings are a form of a lossy compression mechanism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.8">While the embedding space is optimized for a predefined purpose, it isn’t perfect in two senses. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.9">First, it optimizes a particular loss function that may suit one purpose more than another, and second, it does so while trading off other aspects, such as storage and run time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.10">We are seeing a trend within the embedding space where the dimensionality—the size of the embedding vector—is growing higher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.427.11">A higher dimensionality accommodates a broader context per vector, thus opening the door for better retrieval mechanisms that, in turn, accommodate domains that require deep and complex insights, such as the legal space </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.428.1">or journalism.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.429.1">Another downside is the fact that in order to accommodate for the added information that the external data source is providing, the prompt that is sent to the LLM needs to grow in size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.429.2">Now, the prompt isn’t expected to host the entire database’s text. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.429.3">A preliminary mechanism is first applied to narrow down the text that might be relevant, as we have seen in our code example in the healthcare space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.429.4">Still, a cutoff must be applied to the amount of data that is sent within the prompt, thus trading off the amount of context the LLM has to </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.430.1">refer to.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="calibre135"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.431.1">Applications of RAGs</span></h4>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.432.1">The immediate use cases </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1032" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.433.1">of RAGs are related to having an engine that is dedicated to a narrow need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.433.2">Some examples can be seen in </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.434.1">the following:</span></span></p>

<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.435.1">Costumer service chatbot</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.436.1">: These appeal to companies that they seek to cater to </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.437.1">their customers.</span></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.438.1">Company knowledge base</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.439.1">: This serves as an internal service for the company’s employees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.439.2">A typical company manages several different internal engines, each dedicated to a particular need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.439.3">For instance, an internal website, a payroll app, a service request app, a frontend data explorer (often several), a training service, a legal and compliance source, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.439.4">A RAG could consolidate the variety of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1033" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.440.1"> information as a backend of a company chatbot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.440.2">The employees could prompt it for one of the various needs they have. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.440.3">Here are </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.441.1">some examples:</span></span><ul class="calibre17"><li class="calibre15"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.442.1">“What is the policy for paid time off for </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.443.1">full-time employees?”</span></span></li><li class="calibre15"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.444.1">“Which SQL table maps between client name and a unique client identifier, and who provides access to </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.445.1">this table?”</span></span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.446.1">Domain-specific LLM</span></strong><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.447.1">: This could be designed in the form of RAGs, thus erasing the need to train on the domain’s specific data. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.447.2">This could serve research, marketing, and education, to name a few areas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.447.3">For example, imagine you study a particular topic from a particular book or research paper; it is simple to make those documents available for retrieval and ask the LLM to search, summarize, answer particular questions, </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.448.1">and simplify.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.449.1">As we identify RAGs as a key technology to perhaps dominate in-house costumed development, let’s discuss the heavier and more comprehensive approach of customizing the </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.450.1">LLM itself.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="calibre135"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.451.1">Customizing LLMs</span></h4>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.452.1">The customization trend will continue intensifying</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1034" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.453.1"> as a customized LLM presents a complete holistic product that is proprietary to its maker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.453.2">We’re likely to see industry or task-specific LLMs becoming the norm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.453.3">From LLMs tailored to legal jargon to those adept at medical diagnoses, the future is specialized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.453.4">This will involve the various design choices of model pre-training, model fine-tuning, and retrieval-based designs, which leverage </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.454.1">dedicated datasets.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.455.1">While the typical RAG caters to leveraging in-house and non-public data, a customized LLM suits cases where an entire domain is to be learned and mastered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.455.2">For instance, if we wanted to choose one of these two approaches as a tool that would ideate and synthesize NLP and AI solutions, we would choose an LLM that was trained on the relevant data, e.g., publications, learning material, and patents, and not a RAG that simply makes this data available to a generic LLM. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.455.3">The customized LLM would offer a chain of thought that is inherited from the data it was trained on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.455.4">The RAG would leverage a generic LLM </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1035" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.456.1">with its generic chain of thought, where it would have additional data to </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.457.1">refer to.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.458.1">We have now touched on the four pillars for enhancing LLMs’ performance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.458.2">Going from optimizing the prompt to putting together a dedicated LLM, one must trade off the potential improvement in performance with the cost and complexity of the process. </span><span><em class="italic"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.459.1">Figure 10</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.460.1">.3</span></em><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.461.1"> portrays </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.462.1">this concept:</span></span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.1">Such a shift won’t just streamline the coding process; it could fundamentally transform who gets to create software. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.2">Non-technical individuals could engage more directly in software development, bridging the gap between idea generation and execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.3">Start-ups, for instance, could swiftly turn their visions into prototypes, speeding up innovation cycles and fostering a more inclusive tech ecosystem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.4">We anticipate this will revolutionize several business disciplines, for example, technical product management. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.5">Of course, this doesn’t imply that traditional coding skills will become obsolete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.6">On the contrary, understanding the intricacies of programming languages will always have its value, especially for tasks that demand precision and nuance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.471.7">However, LLMs can act as invaluable assistants, catching</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1037" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.472.1"> bugs, suggesting optimizations, or even helping with mundane and repetitive tasks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.472.2">This synergy between human developers and LLMs might lead to a golden age of software development where creativity takes center stage and the technical barriers are lowered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.472.3">Furthermore, as LLMs get more adept at understanding and generating code, we might also see an increase in the development of novel algorithms, frameworks, and tools. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.472.4">These advancements could be spurred on by the unique perspective that a machine brings to problem-solving, supplemented by the vast amounts of data and patterns it has been </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.473.1">trained on.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.474.1">In summary, the future of LLMs in the coding world holds the promises of collaboration, inclusivity, and innovation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.474.2">While challenges will undoubtedly arise, the potential benefits for both seasoned developers and newcomers to the field </span><span><span class="kobospan" id="kobo.475.1">are enormous.</span></span></p>
