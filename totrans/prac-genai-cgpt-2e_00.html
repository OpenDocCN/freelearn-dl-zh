<div><h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-4">Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">We are living in an era of rapid technological transformation, where <strong class="keyWord">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AI</strong>) is no longer just a tool but an active collaborator in our daily lives. Among the many advancements in AI, generative AI has emerged as a disruptive force, reshaping how we interact with technology, create content, and drive innovation. From generating human-like text and producing stunning visuals to composing music and even writing code, generative AI has unlocked possibilities that once belonged only to science fiction.</p>
<p class="normal">This book serves as a comprehensive guide to generative AI, with a special focus on ChatGPT, one of the most influential players in this evolving landscape. It is designed for both beginners and professionals who want to understand the underlying principles, practical applications, and enterprise-scale implementations of <strong class="keyWord">large language models</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">LLMs</strong>).</p>
<p class="normal">The book is structured into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Part 1, Fundamentals of Generative AI and OpenAI</em>,<em class="italic"> </em>introduces the core concepts of generative AI, the evolution of AI models, and the mechanics behind large foundation models. It also provides an in-depth look at OpenAI, its model families (such as GPT-4, DALL·E, and Whisper), and the rapid adoption of ChatGPT.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Part 2, ChatGPT in Action</em>, explores how to interact with ChatGPT effectively, covering prompt engineering techniques and real-world applications across various domains, including productivity, software development, marketing, research, and creativity. This section also introduces GPTs, the next step in AI customization, allowing users to build their own personalized AI assistants.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Part 3, OpenAI for Enterprises</em>, shifts the focus to enterprise-scale applications, discussing how businesses can leverage OpenAI’s models via APIs to develop powerful AI-driven solutions. The book concludes with a forward-looking epilogue, analyzing the broader AI landscape and what to expect in the near future.</li>
</ul>
