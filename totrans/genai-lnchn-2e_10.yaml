    to be ensured, it needs to be robust at scale, and finally, monitoring has to
    be in place. Maintaining rigorous testing, auditing, and ethical safeguards is
    essential for trustworthy deployment. Therefore, in this chapter, we’ll first
    examine the pre-deployment requirements for LLM applications, including performance
    metrics and security considerations. We’ll then explore deployment options, from
    simple web servers to more sophisticated orchestration tools such as Kubernetes.
    Finally, we’ll delve into observability practices, covering monitoring strategies
    and tools that ensure your deployed applications perform reliably in production.

    measures weren’t designed to handle. Standard controls often fail against attacks

- en: LLM applications differ fundamentally from conventional software because they
    accept both system instructions and user data through the same text channel, produce
    nondeterministic outputs, and manage context in ways that can expose or mix up
    sensitive information. For example, attackers have extracted hidden system prompts
    by simply asking some models to repeat their instructions, and firms have suffered
    from models inventing fictitious legal precedents. Moreover, simple pattern‐matching
    filters can be bypassed by cleverly rephrased malicious inputs, making semantic‐aware
    defenses essential.

    runs smoothly, scales well, and stays easy to manage. To do that, you’ll need
    to think across three key areas, each with its own challenges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First is *application deployment and APIs*. This is where you set up API endpoints
    for your LangChain applications, making sure they can communicate efficiently
    with other systems. You’ll also want to use containerization and orchestration
    to keep things consistent and manageable as your app grows. And, of course, you
    can’t forget about scaling and load balancing—these are what keep your application
    responsive when demand spikes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next is *observability and monitoring*, which is keeping an eye on how your
    application is performing once it’s live. This means tracking key metrics, watching
    costs so they don’t spiral out of control, and having solid debugging and tracing
    tools in place. Good observability helps you catch issues early and ensures your
    system keeps running smoothly without surprises.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third area is *model infrastructure*, which might not be needed in every
    case. You’ll need to choose the right serving frameworks, like vLLM or TensorRT-LLM,
    fine-tune your hardware setup, and use techniques like quantization to make sure
    your models run efficiently without wasting resources.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    must be addressed for a robust production system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs are typically utilized either through external providers or by self-hosting
    models on your own infrastructure. With external providers, companies like OpenAI
    and Anthropic handle the heavy computational lifting, while LangChain helps you
    implement the business logic around these services. On the other hand, self-hosting
    open-source LLMs offers a different set of advantages, particularly when it comes
    to managing latency, enhancing privacy, and potentially reducing costs in high-usage
    scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The economics of self-hosting versus API usage, therefore, depend on many factors,
    including your usage patterns, model size, hardware availability, and operational
    expertise. These trade-offs require careful analysis – while some organizations
    report cost savings for high-volume applications, others find API services more
    economical when accounting for the total cost of ownership, including maintenance
    and expertise. Please refer back to [*Chapter 2*](E_Chapter_2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044)

    create API endpoints using web frameworks like FastAPI or Flask. This approach
    gives you full control over how your LangChain chains and agents are exposed to
    clients. **FastAPI** is a modern, high-performance web framework that works particularly
    well with LangChain applications. It provides automatic API documentation, type
    checking, and support for asynchronous endpoints – all valuable features when
    working with LLM applications. To deploy LangChain applications as web services,
    FastAPI offers several advantages that make it well suited for LLM-based applications.
    It provides native support for asynchronous programming (critical for handling
    concurrent LLM requests efficiently), automatic API documentation, and robust

    we need to consider how our application will handle increased load. While Uvicorn
    itself does not provide built-in load-balancing functionality, it can work together
    with other tools or technologies such as Nginx or HAProxy to achieve load balancing
    in a deployment setup, which distributes the incoming client requests across multiple

    with half the VRAM, substantially reducing hardware costs. Request batching is
    equally important – configure your serving layer to automatically group multiple
    user requests when possible. This improves throughput by 3-5x compared to processing
    requests individually, allowing you to serve more users with the same hardware.
    Finally, pay attention to the attention key-value cache, which often consumes
    more memory than the model itself. Setting appropriate context length limits and
    implementing cache expiration strategies prevents memory overflow during long
