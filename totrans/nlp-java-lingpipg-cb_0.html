This book starts as a private repository of LingPipe recipes that Baldwin continually referred to when facing repeated but twitchy NLP problems with system building. We are an open source company but the code never merited sharing. Now they are shared.</p><p class="calibre9">Honestly, the LingPipe API is an intimidating and opaque edifice to code against like any rich and complex Java API. Add in the "black arts" quality needed to get NLP systems working and we have the perfect conditions to satisfy the need for a recipe book that minimizes theory and maximizes the practicality of getting the job done with best practices sprinkled in from 20 years in the business.</p><p class="calibre9">This book is about getting the job done; damn the theory! Take this book and build the next generation of NLP systems and send us a note about what you did.</p><p class="calibre9">LingPipe is the best tool on the planet to build NLP systems with; this book is the way to use it.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Simple Classifiers" href="part0014_split_000.html#page">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre10">Simple Classifiers</em>, explains that a huge percentage of NLP problems are actually classification problems. This chapter covers very simple but powerful classifiers based on character sequences and then brings in evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and metrics such as precision, recall, and the always-BS-resisting confusion matrix. You get to train yourself on your own and download data from Twitter. The chapter ends with a simple sentiment example.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. Finding and Working with Words" href="part0027_split_000.html#page">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre10">Finding and Working with Words</em>, is exactly as boring as it sounds but there are some high points. The last recipe will show you how to tokenize Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese languages, which doesn't have whitespaces, to help define words. We will show you how to wrap Lucene tokenizers, which cover all kinds of fun languages such as Arabic. Almost everything later in the book relies on tokenization.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. Advanced Classifiers" href="part0036_split_000.html#page">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre10">Advanced Classifiers</em>, introduces the star of modern NLP systems—logistic regression classifiers. 20 years of hard-won experience lurks in this chapter. We will address the life cycle around building classifiers and how to create training data, cheat when creating training data with active learning, and how to tune and make the classifiers work faster.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Tagging Words and Tokens" href="part0051_split_000.html#page">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre10">Tagging Words and Tokens</em>, explains that language is about words. This chapter focuses on ways of applying categories to tokens, which in turn drives many of the high-end uses of LingPipe such as entity detection (people/places/orgs in text), part-of-speech tagging, and more. It starts with tag clouds, which have been described as "mullet of the Internet" and ends with a foundational recipe for conditional random fields (CRF), which can provide state-of-the-art performance for entity-detection tasks. In between, we will address confidence-tagged words, which is likely to be a very important dimension of more sophisticated systems.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Finding Spans in Text – Chunking" href="part0061_split_000.html#page">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre10">Finding Spans in Text – Chunking</em>, shows that text is not words alone. It is collections of words, usually in spans. This chapter will advance from word tagging to span tagging, which brings in capabilities such as finding sentences, named entities, and basal NPs and VPs. The full power of CRFs are addressed with discussions on feature extraction and tuning. Dictionary approaches are discussed as they are ways of combining chunkings.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. String Comparison and Clustering" href="part0075_split_000.html#page">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre10">String Comparison and Clustering</em>, focuses on comparing text with each other, independent of a trained classifier. The technologies range from the hugely practical spellchecking to the hopeful but often frustrating Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) clustering approach. Less presumptive technologies such as single-link and complete-link clustering have driven major commercial successes for us. Don't ignore this chapter.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. Finding Coreference Between Concepts/People" href="part0085_split_000.html#page">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre10">Finding Coreference Between Concepts/People</em>, lays the future but unfortunately, you won't get the ultimate recipe, just our best efforts so far. This is one of the bleeding edges of industrial and academic NLP efforts that has tremendous potential. Potential is why we include our efforts to help grease the way to see this technology in use.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03" class="calibre1"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">You need some NLP problems and a solid foundation in Java, a computer, and a developer-savvy approach.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04" class="calibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">If you have NLP problems or you want to educate yourself in comment NLP issues, this book is for you. With some creativity, you can train yourself into being a solid NLP developer, a beast so rare that they are seen about as often as unicorns, with the result of more interesting job prospects in hot technology areas such as Silicon Valley or New York City.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05" class="calibre1"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p class="calibre9">Java is a pretty awful language to put into a recipe book with a 66-character limit on lines for code. The overriding convention is that the code is ugly and we apologize.</p><p class="calibre9">Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Once the string is read in from the console, then <code class="email">classifier.classify(input)</code> is called, which returns <code class="email">Classification</code>."</p><p class="calibre9">A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public static List&lt;String[]&gt; filterJaccard(List&lt;String[]&gt; texts, TokenizerFactory tokFactory, double cutoff) {
  JaccardDistance jaccardD = new JaccardDistance(tokFactory);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
