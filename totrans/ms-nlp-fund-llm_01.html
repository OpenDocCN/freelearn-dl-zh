<p class="calibre6">The target audience of the book is professionals who work with text as part of their projects. This may include NLP practitioners, who may be beginners, as well as those who do not typically work with text.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre4"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>What is natural language processing?</h1>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">NLP</strong> is a field of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) focused on the interaction between computers and human<a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> languages. It involves using computational<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> techniques to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it possible for computers to understand and respond to human input naturally and meaningfully.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>The history and evolution of natural language processing</h2>
<p class="calibre6">The history of NLP is a fascinating<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> journey through time, tracing back to the 1950s, with significant contributions from pioneers such as Alan Turing. Turing’s seminal paper, <em class="italic">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em>, introduced the Turing test, laying the groundwork for future explorations in AI and NLP. This period marked the inception of symbolic NLP, characterized by the use of rule-based systems, such as the notable Georgetown experiment in 1954, which ambitiously aimed to solve machine translation by generating a translation of Russian content into English (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment</a>). Despite early optimism, progress was slow, revealing the complexities of language understanding and generation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of early NLP systems, which demonstrated the potential for machines to engage in human-like interactions using limited vocabularies and knowledge bases. This era also witnessed the creation of conceptual ontologies, crucial for structuring real-world information in a computer-understandable format. However, the limitations of rule-based methods led to a paradigm shift in the late 1980s towards statistical NLP, fueled by advances in ML and increased computational power. This shift enabled more effective learning from large corpora, significantly advancing machine translation and other NLP tasks. This paradigm shift not only represented a technological and methodological advancement but also underscored a conceptual evolution in the approach to linguistics within NLP. In moving away from the rigidity of predefined grammar rules, this transition embraced corpus linguistics, a method that allows machines to “perceive” and understand languages through extensive exposure to large bodies of text. This approach reflects a more empirical and data-driven understanding of language, where patterns and <a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>meanings are derived from actual language use rather than theoretical constructs, enabling more nuanced and flexible language processing capabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Entering the 21st century, the emergence of the web provided vast amounts of data, catalyzing research in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. The breakthrough came with the advent of neural NLP in the 2010s, where DL techniques began to dominate, offering unprecedented accuracy in language modeling and parsing. This era has been marked by the development of sophisticated models such as Word2Vec and the proliferation of deep neural networks, driving NLP towards more natural and effective human-computer interaction. As we continue to build on these advancements, NLP stands at the forefront of AI research, with its history reflecting a relentless pursuit of understanding and replicating the nuances of human language.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In recent years, NLP has also been applied to a wide range of industries, such as healthcare, finance, and social media, where it has been used to automate decision-making and enhance communication between humans and machines. For example, NLP has been used to extract information from medical documents, analyze customer feedback, translate documents between languages, and search through enormous amounts of posts.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre4"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Initial strategies in the machine processing of natural language</h1>
<p class="calibre6">Traditional methods in NLP consist of text preprocessing, which is synonymous with text preparation, which<a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> is then followed by applying <strong class="bold">ML</strong> methods. Preprocessing text is an essential step in NLP and ML applications. It involves cleaning and transforming the original text data into a form that can be easily understood and analyzed by ML algorithms. The goal of preprocessing is to remove noise and inconsistencies and standardize the data, making it more suitable for advanced NLP and ML methods.</p>
<p class="calibre6">One of the key benefits of preprocessing is that it can significantly improve the performance of ML algorithms. For example, removing stop words, which are common words that do not carry much meaning, such as “the” and “is,” can help reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier for the algorithm to identify patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Take the following sentence as an example:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">I am going to the store to buy some milk </strong><strong class="bold">and bread</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After removing the stop words, we have the following:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">going store buy </strong><strong class="bold">milk bread</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the example sentence, the stop words “<strong class="bold">I</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">am</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">to</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">the</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">some</strong>,” and “<strong class="bold">and</strong>” do not add any additional meaning to the sentence and can be removed without changing the overall meaning <a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of the sentence. It should be emphasized that the removal of stop words needs to be tailored to the specific objective, as the omission of a particular word might be trivial in one context but detrimental in another.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Additionally, <strong class="bold">stemming</strong> and <strong class="bold">lemmatization</strong>, which reduce <a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>words to their base forms, can help reduce the <a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>number of unique words in the data, making it easier for the algorithm to identify relationships between them, which will be explained completely in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Take the following sentence as an example:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">The boys ran, jumped, and </strong><strong class="bold">swam quickly</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After applying stemming, which reduces each word to its root or stem form, disregarding word tense or derivational affixes, we might get:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">The boy ran, jump, and </strong><strong class="bold">swam quick</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Stemming simplifies the text to its base forms. In this example, “<strong class="bold">ran</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">jumped</strong>,” and “<strong class="bold">swam</strong>” are reduced to “<strong class="bold">ran</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">jump</strong>,” and “<strong class="bold">swam</strong>,” respectively. Note that “ran” and “swam” do not change, as stemming often results in words that are close to their root form but not exactly the dictionary base form. This process helps reduce the complexity of the text data, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to match and analyze patterns without getting bogged down by variations of the same word.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Take the following sentence as an example:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">The boys ran, jumped, and </strong><strong class="bold">swam quickly</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After applying lemmatization, which considers the morphological analysis of the words, aiming to return the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma, we get:</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">The boy run, jump, and </strong><strong class="bold">swim quickly</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lemmatization accurately converts “<strong class="bold">ran</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">jumped</strong>,” and “<strong class="bold">swam</strong>” to “<strong class="bold">run</strong>,” “<strong class="bold">jump</strong>,” and “<strong class="bold">swim</strong>.” This process takes into account the part of speech of each word, ensuring that the reduction to the base form is both grammatically and contextually appropriate. Unlike stemming, lemmatization provides a more precise reduction to the base form, ensuring <a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>that the processed text remains meaningful and contextually accurate. This enhances the performance of NLP models by enabling them to understand and process language more effectively, reducing the dataset’s complexity while maintaining the integrity of the original text.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Two other important aspects of preprocessing <a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>are data normalization and data cleaning. <strong class="bold">Data normalization</strong> includes converting all text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and standardizing the format of the data. This helps to ensure that the algorithm does not treat different variations of the same word as separate entities, which can lead to inaccurate results.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><strong class="bold">Data cleaning</strong> includes removing<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> duplicate or irrelevant data and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data. This is particularly important in large datasets, where manual cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated preprocessing tools can help to quickly identify and remove errors, making the data more reliable for analysis.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.1</em> portrays a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. We will cover this code example in <a href="B18949_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>:</p>

<p class="calibre6">In conclusion, preprocessing text is a vital step in NLP and ML applications; it improves the performance of ML algorithms by removing noise and inconsistencies and standardizing the data. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in data preparation for NLP tasks and in <a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>data cleaning. By investing time and resources in preprocessing, one can ensure that the data is of high quality and is ready for advanced NLP and ML methods, resulting in more accurate and reliable results.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As our text data is prepared for further processing, the next step typically involves fitting an ML model to it.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre4"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>A winning synergy – the coming together of NLP and ML</h1>
<p class="calibre6">ML is a subfield of AI that involves training<a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> algorithms to learn from data, allowing them to make predictions or decisions without those being<a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> explicitly programmed. ML is driving advancements in so many different fields, such as computer vision, voice recognition, and, of course, NLP.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Diving a little more into the specific techniques of ML, a particular technique used in NLP is <strong class="bold">statistical language modeling</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>involves training algorithms on large text corpora to predict the likelihood of a given sequence of words. This is used in a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Another essential technique is <strong class="bold">DL</strong>, which is a subfield of ML that involves training artificial neural <a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>networks on large amounts of data. DL models, such as <strong class="bold">convolutional neural networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNNs</strong>) and <strong class="bold">recurrent neural networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">RNNs</strong>), have been <a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>shown to be adequate for NLP tasks such as language understanding, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="calibre4"><a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Introduction to math and statistics in NLP</h1>
<p class="calibre6">The solid base for NLP and ML is the <a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>mathematical foundations from which the algorithms stem. In particular, the key foundations are linear algebra, statistics and probability, and optimization theory. <a href="B18949_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> will survey the key topics you will need to understand these topics. Throughout the book, we will present proofs and justifications for the various methods and hypotheses.</p>
<p class="calibre6">One of the challenges in NLP is <a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>dealing with the vast amount of data that is generated in human language. This includes understanding the context, as well as the meaning of the words and relationships between them. To deal with this challenge, researchers have developed various techniques, such as embeddings and attention mechanisms, which represent the meaning of words in a numerical format and help identify the most critical parts of the text, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Another challenge in NLP is the need for labeled data, as manually annotating large text corpora is expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, researchers have developed unsupervised and weakly supervised methods that can learn from unlabeled data, such as clustering, topic modeling, and self-supervised learning.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Overall, NLP is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to transform the way we interact with computers and<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> information. It is used in various applications, from chatbots and language <a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>translation to text summarization and sentiment analysis. The use of ML techniques, such as statistical language modeling and DL, has been crucial in developing these systems. Ongoing research addresses the remaining challenges, such as understanding context and dealing with the lack of labeled data.</p>
<p class="calibre6">One of the most significant<a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> advances in NLP has been the development of pre-trained language models, such as <strong class="bold">bidirectional encoder representations from transformers</strong> (<strong class="bold">BERTs</strong>) and <strong class="bold">generative pre-trained transformers</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPTs</strong>). These models have been trained on massive amounts <a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or language translation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Transformers, the technology behind the BERT and GPT models, revolutionized NLP by enabling machines to understand the context of words in sentences more effectively. Unlike previous methods that processed text linearly, transformers can handle words in parallel, capturing nuances in language through attention mechanisms. This allows them to discern the importance of each word relative to others, greatly enhancing the model’s ability to grasp complex language patterns and nuances and setting a new standard for accuracy and fluency in NLP applications. This has enhanced the creation of NLP applications and has led to improved performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.3</em> details the functional design of the Transformer component.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Another important development in NLP has been the increase in the availability of large amounts of annotated text data, which has allowed for the training of more accurate models. Additionally, the development of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning <a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>techniques has allowed for the training of models on smaller amounts of labeled data, making it possible to apply NLP in a wider range of scenarios.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Language models have had a significant impact on the field of NLP. One of the key ways that language models have changed the field is by improving the accuracy and effectiveness of natural language processing tasks. For example, many language models have been trained on large amounts of text data, allowing them to better understand the nuances and complexities of human language. This has led to improved performance in tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Another way that language models have changed the field of NLP is by enabling the development of more advanced, sophisticated NLP<a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> systems. For example, some language models, such as GPT, can generate human-like text, which has opened up new possibilities for natural language generation and dialogue systems. Other language models, such as BERT, have improved the performance of tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Language models have also changed the field by making it more accessible to a broader range of people. With the advent of pre-trained language models, developers can now easily fine-tune these models to specific tasks without the need for large amounts of labeled data or the expertise to train models from scratch. This has made it easier for developers to build NLP applications and has led to an explosion of new NLP-based products and services.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Overall, language models have played a key role in advancing the field of NLP by improving the performance of existing NLP tasks, enabling the development of more advanced NLP systems, and making NLP more accessible to a broader range of people.</p>
