    <h1 id="_idParaDest-31" class="heading-1">Understanding the power of RAG</h1>
    <p class="normal">RAG<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> was introduced by Meta researchers in 2020 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401v4"><span class="url">https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401v4</span></a>) as a framework that allows GenAI models to leverage external data that is not part of model training to enhance the output. </p>
    <p class="normal">It is a widely known fact that LLMs suffer from hallucinations. One of the classic real-world examples of LLMs hallucinating is the case of Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman, the New York law firm that was fined for submitting a legal brief containing fake citations generated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a case against Colombian airline Avianca. They were subsequently fined thousands of dollars, and they are likely to have lost more in reputational damage. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/lawyers-fined-after-citing-bogus-cases-from-chatgpt-research-12908318"><span class="url">https://news.sky.com/story/lawyers-fined-after-citing-bogus-cases-from-chatgpt-research-12908318</span></a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">LLM hallucinations<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> can arise from several factors, such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Overfitting to training data</strong>: During training, the LLM might overfit to statistical patterns in the training data. This can lead the model to prioritize replicating those patterns over generating factually accurate content.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Lack of causal reasoning</strong>: LLMs excel at identifying statistical relationships between words but may struggle to understand cause-and-effect relationships. This can lead to outputs that are grammatically correct but factually implausible.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Temperature configuration</strong>: LLMs can be configured with a parameter called <strong class="keyWord">temperature</strong>, a number between <code class="inlineCode">0</code> and <code class="inlineCode">1</code> that controls the randomness in text generation. Higher temperatures increase creativity but also the likelihood of hallucinations as the model deviates from expected responses.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"> <strong class="screenText">Missing information</strong>: If the information required to generate an accurate response is not included in the training data, the model might generate plausible sounding but incorrect answers.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Flawed or biased training data</strong>: The quality of the training process plays a significant role. If the dataset contains biases or inaccuracies, the model may perpetuate <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>these issues, leading to hallucinations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">While hallucinations are a significant challenge, several methods can help mitigate them to some extent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Prompt engineering</strong>: This involves<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> carefully crafting and iteratively refining the instructions or queries given to the LLM to elicit consistent and accurate responses. For instance, asking an LLM
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"> List five key benefits of Neo4j for knowledge graphs 
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">provides more structure and precision compared to the broad query like:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Tell me about Neo4j 
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The former query specifies the expected output, leading the model to focus on a concise and relevant list of benefits, while the latter might yield a verbose or tangential response. Prompt engineering helps guide the model to stay within the desired scope of information and reduces the chances of it producing irrelevant or fabricated outputs. For a detailed exploration of prompt engineering techniques and best practices, check out this <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>guide: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering"><span class="url">https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering</span></a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">In-context learning</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">few-shot prompting</strong>): In this method, examples are included within the prompt to guide<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> the LLM toward accurate, task-specific responses. For instance, when asking for a product comparison, providing a few examples of properly structured comparisons within the prompt helps the model mimic the pattern. This approach leverages the model’s capability to infer context and adjust its responses based on the given examples, making it effective for domain-specific tasks.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Fine-tuning</strong>: This involves training an<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> already pre-trained LLM further on a specific dataset to adapt it to specialized domains or tasks. This process enhances the model’s ability to generate domain-specific, relevant, and accurate responses. One popular method for fine-tuning is <strong class="keyWord">Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RLHF</strong>), where <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>human evaluators guide the model by scoring its outputs. These scores are used to adjust the model’s behavior, aligning it with human expectations. For example, fine-tuning an LLM on a company’s internal documentation ensures it produces accurate and relevant outputs tailored to the organization’s specific needs. If prompted with
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Explain the onboarding process for new hires
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">a fine-tuned model might provide a detailed explanation consistent with the company’s policies, whereas a general model might offer a vague or unrelated response. Let us take another example scenario to understand how using RLHF, you can improve responses. </p>
    <p class="normal">Suppose the LLM was initially asked:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">What are the benefits of using XYZ software? 
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The response might include generic benefits that do not align with the software’s unique features. With RLHF, human evaluators score the response based on accuracy, relevance, and completeness. For instance, the initial response could be:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">XYZ software improves productivity, enhances collaboration, and reduces costs.
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The feedback may be:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Too generic; lacks specifics about XYZ software.
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">After fine-tuning with human feedback, the result could be a more accurate and tailored response, as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">XYZ software offers real-time data synchronization, customizable workflows, and advanced security features, making it ideal for enterprise resource planning.
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">RLHF is <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>especially valuable in reducing hallucinations because it emphasizes learning from human-curated feedback.</p>
    <p class="normal">While these methods provide significant improvements, they still fall short in one critical area: enabling organizations to use domain-specific knowledge to rapidly build accurate, contextual, and explainable GenAI applications. The solution lies in <strong class="keyWord">grounding</strong> – a concept that ties the model’s responses to real-world facts or data. This<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> approach forms the foundation of a new paradigm in text generation called RAG. By dynamically retrieving factual information from reliable knowledge sources, RAG ensures outputs are both accurate and contextually aligned. RAG tries to address LLM hallucinations by incorporating relevant information from factual knowledge repositories. </p>
    <p class="normal">The term retrieval-augmented generation, or <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>RAG for short, was first introduced by researchers at <strong class="keyWord">Facebook AI Research</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FAIR</strong>) in a paper titled <em class="italic">Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks</em>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401"><span class="url">https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401</span></a>, submitted in May 2020.</p>
    <p class="normal">The paper proposed <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>RAG as a hybrid architecture (refer to <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>) that combines a neural retriever with a sequence-to-sequence generator. The <strong class="keyWord">retriever</strong> fetches <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>relevant documents from an external knowledge base, which are then used as context for the generator to produce outputs grounded in factual data. This approach was shown to significantly improve performance on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain question-answering and dialogue systems, by reducing the reliance on the model’s internal knowledge and enhancing factual accuracy. RAG addresses the previously mentioned shortcomings of LLMs by introducing a critical element: the ability to retrieve relevant knowledge from supplementary or domain-specific data sources.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.1 — RAG architecture proposed in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks research paper by FAIR</p>
    <p class="normal">Additionally, RAG pipelines offer the <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>potential to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. Instead of embedding all knowledge within the model’s parameters—which would require extensive resources—RAG allows the model to retrieve information dynamically, keeping it lightweight and scalable.</p>
    <p class="normal">The next section in this chapter will delve deeper into the inner workings of RAG, exploring how it bridges the gap between raw generation and knowledge-grounded text production.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-32" class="heading-1">Deconstructing the RAG flow</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let us now deconstruct the building <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>blocks of a RAG model and help you understand how it functions.</p>
    <p class="normal">First, we will take a look at the regular LLM application flow. <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em> illustrates this basic flow.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B31107_02_2.png" alt="Figure 2.2 — The basic flow of information in a chat application with an LLM" width="495" height="310"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.2 — The basic flow of information in a chat application with an LLM</p>
    <p class="normal">Here is what<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> happens when a user prompts an LLM</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="screenText">User sends a prompt</strong>: The process begins with a user sending a prompt to an LLM chat API. This prompt could be a question, an instruction, or any other request for information or content generation.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">LLM API processes the prompt</strong>: The LLM chat API receives the user’s prompt and transmits it to an LLM. LLMs are AI models trained on massive amounts of text data, allowing them to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">LLM generates a response</strong>: The LLM then processes the prompt and formulates a response. This response is sent back to the LLM chat API, which then transmits it to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">From this flow, we can see that the LLM is responsible for providing the answer and there is no other process in between. This is the most common usage without RAG in the request-response flow. </p>
    <p class="normal">Now let us take a look at where RAG fits into this workflow. </p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B31107_02_3.png" alt="Figure 2.3 — The flow of information in a chat application with the RAG model" width="530" height="595"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.3 — The flow of information in a chat application with the RAG model</p>
    <p class="normal">We can see from <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em> that<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> we have an intermediate data source before the actual LLM service invocation that can provide the context for the LLM request: </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="screenText">User sends prompt</strong>: The process starts with the user sending a prompt or question through a chat interface. This prompt could be anything the user wants information about or needs help with.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">RAG model processes prompt</strong>: The prompt is received by a chat API, which then relays it to the RAG model. The RAG model has two main components working together: the <em class="italic">retriever</em> (discussed in Step <em class="italic">3</em>) and the <em class="italic">encoder-decoder</em> (discussed in Step <em class="italic">4</em>).</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">Retriever</strong>: This component searches through a knowledge repository, which may include unstructured documents, passages, or structured data such as tables or knowledge graphs. Its role is to locate the most relevant information needed to address the user’s prompt.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">We will cover a simple example of the retriever component. You can review the full code available at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Neo4j-Powered-Applications-with-LLMs/blob/main/ch2/dpr.py"><span class="url">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Neo4j-Powered-Applications-with-LLMs/blob/main/ch2/dpr.py</span></a></p>
    <p class="normal">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>code snippet initializes a <em class="italic">context encoder model</em> and <em class="italic">tokenizer</em> from Hugging Face’s Transformers library:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Let us define a set of documents that we want to store in a document store. We are using a few predefined sentences here for demonstration purposes:

]
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Next, we will store the content defined previously in a content store. Then we will generate an embedding for each of the documents and store them in the content store:

      <li class="numberedList">Now, let us define a method that retrieves the content from the document store based on query input.

    <p class="normal">This involves invoking the LLM API with the input query and context information. Let us take a look at an example of how this works. The following example shows how we can invoke a query with contextual information. This example showcases the use of T5Tokenizer model: </p>

      <p class="normal">We are employing the <strong class="keyWord">T5 model</strong>’s beam search decoding to produce an <br/>accurate and contextually relevant response. <strong class="keyWord">Beam search decoding</strong> is a search algorithm used to find the most likely sequence of tokens (words) during<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> text generation.

By combining efficient information retrieval with advanced language generation models, RAG produces contextually appropriate and knowledge-enriched responses. As we<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> transition to the next section, we will discuss the <strong class="keyWord">retrieval process</strong>. </p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-33" class="heading-1">Retrieving external information for your RAG</h1>
    <p class="normal">Understanding how RAG leverages external knowledge is crucial for appreciating its ability to generate factually accurate and informative responses. This section discusses various <strong class="keyWord">retrieval techniques</strong>, strategies for integrating retrieved information, and practical examples to illustrate these concepts.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-34" class="heading-2">Understanding retrieval techniques and strategies</h2>
    <p class="normal">The success of a RAG <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>model hinges on its ability to retrieve relevant information from a vast external knowledge base using one of the commonly used retrieval techniques. These retrieval methods are essential for sourcing relevant information from large datasets. Common techniques include traditional methods such as BM25 and modern neural approaches such as DPR. Broadly speaking, these techniques can be classified into<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> three <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>categories: <strong class="keyWord">vector similarity search</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">keyword matching</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">passage retrieval</strong>. We will discuss each of them in the following <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>subsections.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-35" class="heading-3">Vector similarity search </h3>
    <p class="normal">The text or query you pass to the <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>LLM is converted into a vector representation called an <strong class="keyWord">embedding</strong>. The vector similarity search compares <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>the vector embeddings to retrieve the <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>closest match. The idea is that related and similar text will have similar embeddings. This technique works as follows:  </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Build an embedding of the input query. We tokenize the input query and generate the vector embedding representation of it:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">query_inputs = question_tokenizer(query, return_tensors=<span class="hljs-string">"pt"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> torch.no_grad():
  query_embeddings = question_encoder(
        **query_inputs
    ).pooler_output
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Build the embeddings of the documents. We generate an embedding for each document using the tokenizer and associate each embedding with its document:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> doc <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> documents:
    doc_inputs = context_tokenizer(doc, return_tensors=<span class="hljs-string">"pt"</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> torch.no_grad():
        doc_embeddings.append(
            context_encoder(**doc_inputs).pooler_output)
doc_embeddings = torch.cat(doc_embeddings)
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Find similar documents using dot product calculation. This step uses the input query embedding and searches the document embeddings for results similar to the input query:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">scores = torch.matmul(query_embeddings, doc_embeddings.T).squeeze()
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Sort the documents by the relevancy score and return the results. The results contain the matching documents along with a score representing how similar it is to the input query. We will order the results in the order we want, most similar to least similar:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">ranked_docs = <span class="hljs-built_in">sorted</span>(
    <span class="hljs-built_in">zip</span>(documents, scores), key=<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span> x: x[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>], reverse=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Let us run this example to see what the results would look like. </p>
    <p class="normal">The following is a sample input query:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">What are the benefits of solar energy?
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The following is the sample output (ranked documents):</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Document: Solar energy is a renewable source of power., Score: <span class="hljs-number">80.8264</span>
....
Document: Graph databases like Neo4j are used to model <span class="hljs-built_in">complex</span> relationships., Score: <span class="hljs-number">52.8945</span>
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>code demonstrates how to <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>use DPR to encode a query and a set of documents into high-dimensional vector representations. By computing similarity scores, such as the dot product between the query vector and document vectors, the model evaluates the relevance of each document to the query. The documents are then ranked based on their similarity scores, with the most relevant ones appearing at the top. This process highlights the power of vector-based retrieval in effectively identifying contextually relevant information from a diverse set of documents, even when they include a mix of related and unrelated content.</p>

    <h3 id="_idParaDest-36" class="heading-3">Keyword matching </h3>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Keyword matching</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>simpler approach that identifies documents containing keywords <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>present in the user prompt. While efficient, it can be susceptible to noise and misses documents with relevant synonyms. BM25 is a keyword-based probabilistic retri<a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>eval function that scores documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, considering term frequency and document length. The flow of this approach looks as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Build the BM25 corpus using the documents. We will tokenize documents and build a corpus from this. We will build the BM25 corpus:

bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized_corpus, k1=<span class="hljs-number">1.5</span>, b=<span class="hljs-number">0.75</span>)

      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Tokenize the query to search using it:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">tokenized_query = query.split()

      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Query the BM25 corpus using the tokenized query. This returns the scores for matching documents:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">scores = bm25.get_scores(tokenized_query)

      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">We will take these scores, order the documents in the required order, and return them:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">ranked_docs = <span class="hljs-built_in">sorted</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">zip</span>(corpus, scores), key=<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span> x: x[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>], 
    reverse=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">When we run this example, the results would look like this for the given input.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following is a sample input query:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">quick fox

    <p class="normal">The following is the sample output:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Ranked Documents:

.....
Document: Artificial intelligence <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> transforming the world., Score: <span class="hljs-number">0.0000</span>
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The BM25<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> algorithm ranks documents based on their <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>relevance to a query. It relies on the term frequency (how often a keyword appears in a document) and document length, applying a probabilistic scoring function to evaluate relevance. Unlike vector similarity search, which represents both queries and documents as dense numerical vectors in high-dimensional space and measures similarity using mathematical functions such as the dot product, BM25 operates directly on discrete word matches. This means BM25 is efficient and interpretable but can struggle with semantic relationships, as it cannot recognize synonyms or contextual meanings. In contrast, vector similarity search, such as DPR, excels in identifying conceptual similarities even when exact keywords differ, making it more suitable for tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. This snippet illustrates BM25’s utility for straightforward keyword-matching tasks where efficiency and explainability are critical.</p>

    <h3 id="_idParaDest-37" class="heading-3">Passage retrieval </h3>
    <p class="normal">Instead of retrieving entire<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> documents, RAG can focus on specific passages within documents<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> that directly address the user’s query. This allows for more precise information extraction. The initial flow of this approach is very similar to the vector search approach. We get the ranked documents using the approach shown in vector search and then extract relevant passages as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-comment"># Extract passages for the reader</span>
passages = [doc <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> doc, score <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ranked_docs]

max_score_index = torch.argmax(outputs.relevance_logits)
most_relevant_passage = passages[max_score_index]

    <p class="normal">When we run this example for the given input query, the results look as follows.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following is a sample input query:</p>

</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>preceding example illustrates the <strong class="keyWord">passage-retrieval approach</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> more granular than document-level retrieval, focusing on extracting specific passages that directly address the user’s query. By leveraging a <em class="italic">reader model</em> in combination with a <em class="italic">retriever</em>, this approach enhances relevance and specificity, as it identifies not only the most relevant document but also the exact passage within it that best answers the query. </p>
    <p class="normal">Even if a passage has a slightly lower retriever score, the reader may prioritize it because it evaluates relevance more precisely at the word and span levels, considering contextual nuances. The retriever typically calculates a similarity score using the dot product of the query and passage embeddings:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><a id="_idIndexMarker089"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_001.png" alt="" width="622" height="165"/></figure>
    <p class="normal">Here, 𝑞 is <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>the query embedding, <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_002.png" alt="" width="36" height="56"/> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>passage embedding for the <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_003.png" alt="" width="51" height="47"/> passage, and 𝑑 is the dimensionality of the embeddings.</p>
    <p class="normal">The reader, however, refines this further by analyzing the text content of each passage. It assigns a <strong class="keyWord">relevance score</strong> or <strong class="screenText">logit</strong> (also known as <strong class="keyWord">confidence score</strong>) based on the likelihood that a given passage<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> contains the answer. This relevance score is computed from the raw <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>outputs (logits) of the reader model, which considers word-level and span-level interactions between the query and the passage. The formula for the relevance score can be expressed as follows:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><a id="_idIndexMarker096"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_004.png" alt="" width="875" height="55"/></figure>
    <p class="normal">Here, we have the following:</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By combining both stages, the system can identify passages that are not only semantically similar (<em class="italic">retriever stage</em>) but also contextually aligned with the query’s intent (<em class="italic">reader stage</em>). </p>
    <p class="normal">This dual-stage process highlights the strength of passage retrieval in generating highly targeted responses in information retrieval pipelines.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-38" class="heading-2">Integrating the retrieved information</h2>
    <p class="normal">For the last step in the <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>RAG flow, let us look at how we can combine the retriever information with the generation model in a way that synthesizes contextually relevant and coherent responses. Unlike earlier examples, this approach explicitly integrates multiple retrieved passages with the query. By doing so, it creates a single input for the generation model. This allows the model to synthesize a unified and enriched response that goes beyond merely selecting or ranking passages:</p>

    <p class="normal">The preceding code snippet demonstrates how to integrate retrieved documents with a T5 model to generate a synthe<a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>sized response. The <code class="inlineCode">generate()</code> function processes the combined input (query and passages) through the encoder to produce contextual embeddings, <em class="italic">ℎ</em>. These embeddings are then used by the decoder, which generates each token sequentially based on probabilities:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><a id="_idIndexMarker101"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_007.png" alt="" width="750" height="58"/></figure>
    <p class="normal">Here, <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_008.png" alt="" width="47" height="52"/> is the token at position <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_009.png" alt="" width="18" height="45"/>, <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_010.png" alt="" width="40" height="49"/> is the hidden state, and <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><img src="../Images/B21107_02_011.png" alt="" width="42" height="47"/> is the model’s weight matrix. Beam search ensures th<a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>e selection of the most likely sequence by maximizing the overall probability across tokens. Unlike previous examples where individual passages were selected or ranked, this code explicitly combines multiple retrieved documents into a single input alongside the query. This enables the T5 model to process the combined context holistically and produce a coherent response that incorporates information from multiple sources, making it particularly effective for queries requiring synthesis or summarization across multiple passages.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-39" class="heading-1">Building an end-to-end RAG flow</h1>
    <p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>previous sections, we delved into the various steps in the RAG flow individually with simple data to demonstrate the usage.

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-40" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we deep-dived into the world of RAG models. We started by understanding the core principles of RAG and how they differ from traditional generative AI models. This foundational knowledge is crucial as it sets the stage for appreciating the enhanced capabilities that RAG brings to the table. </p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we took a closer look at the architecture of RAG models, deconstructing their components through detailed code examples. By examining the encoder, retriever, and decoder, you gained insights into the inner workings of these models and how they integrate retrieved information to produce more contextually relevant and coherent outputs. </p>
    <p class="normal">We then explored how RAG harnesses the power of information retrieval. These techniques help RAG effectively leverage external knowledge sources to improve the quality of a generated text. This is particularly useful for applications requiring high accuracy and context awareness. You also learned how to a simple RAG model using popular libraries such as Transformers and Hugging Face.</p>
    <p class="normal">As we move forward to the next chapter, <a href="Preface.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, we will build on this foundation. You will learn about graph data modeling and how to create knowledge graphs with Neo4j.</p>
