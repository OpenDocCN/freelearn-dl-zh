			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Boost Coding Efficiency for SQL with Auto-Code Generation</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following key topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An overview of database management languages</li>
				<li>SQL auto-code <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>generation for <strong class="bold">d</strong><strong class="bold">atabase </strong><strong class="bold">a</strong><strong class="bold">dministrators</strong> (<strong class="bold">DBAs</strong>) using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>SQL auto-code <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>generation for <strong class="bold">d</strong><strong class="bold">ata </strong><strong class="bold">e</strong><strong class="bold">ngineers</strong> (<strong class="bold">DEs</strong>) using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>SQL code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In our previous chapter, we discussed an overview of web programming languages before focusing on two <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>dominant ones used in the software industry – <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong class="bold">JS</strong>) and PHP. We demonstrated how auto-code generation, especially Amazon Q Developer, is integrated and can be used by JS and PHP developers to understand the basics, learn syntax, and automatically generate code.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will focus on database management languages. We’ll dive into one of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>dominant database management languages in the software industry, <strong class="bold">Structured Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">SQL</strong>). Using two user personas, DBAs and DEs, we will introduce how auto-code generation through Amazon Q Developer can help you understand the basics, learn syntax, and automatically generate code for common DBA and DE activities. Then, we will explore code explainability to support documentation and code optimization recommendations provided by Amazon Q Developer for SQL.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Overview of database management languages</h1>
			<p>Let’s dive into another widely used area of systems across <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>industries – database management – and explore SQL, a crucial language for handling large datasets, tables, views, users, and so on.</p>
			<p>In the dynamic landscape of database management, SQL serves as the fundamental language for <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>interacting with relational databases. SQL enables DBAs and DEs to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently across various <strong class="bold">Database Management Systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">DBMs</strong>). SQL is vital when working on projects that interact with relational and/or columnar databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, Teradata, and Amazon RedShift. As databases become increasingly complex and critical to business operations, the ability to write efficient and reliable SQL code is paramount. Auto-code generation has emerged as a transformative approach to streamline SQL development processes, automate routine tasks, and enhance productivity for DBAs and DEs alike. Amazon Q Developer, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, offers robust support for SQL code generation. This section explores how Amazon Q Developer revolutionizes SQL development, empowers DBAs and DEs, and facilitates efficient database management and data manipulation.</p>
			<p>For DBAs, SQL plays a pivotal role in database administration and application development by enabling tasks such as defining database structures, managing access control, monitoring log tables, and ensuring data integrity. For DEs, SQL is key for tasks such as loading data in tables, querying data by joining multiple tables, manipulating data using store procedures, and unloading data. However, writing SQL queries and maintaining database schemas can be time-consuming and prone to errors, particularly in environments with extensive data requirements and complex relationships. Amazon Q Developer simplifies SQL development by automating the generation of SQL queries, database schema definitions, and data manipulation scripts. Through its intuitive chat-style interface, DBAs and DEs can interact with Amazon Q Developer to request specific SQL queries or tasks using natural language prompts.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, Amazon Q Developer serves as an educational resource for SQL learners and novice DE. It offers interactive tutorials, explanations of SQL concepts, and practical examples of SQL queries through its chat interface. This educational aspect helps DBAs and DEs grasp SQL fundamentals more effectively and apply them to real-world database management and data manipulation scenarios.</p>
			<p>Experienced DBAs and DEs can use Amazon Q Developer’s advanced features, such as query optimization and performance tuning suggestions. It analyzes SQL queries generated by users, identifies potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and offers recommendations to enhance query execution speed and resource utilization. These optimization capabilities are crucial for maintaining optimal database performance and <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>scalability in production environments. Teams working on database-driven applications can benefit from standardized SQL code templates, shared best practices, and streamlined code review processes.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help a DBA and DE. To illustrate, I will <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>use Amazon <strong class="bold">Relational Database Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDS</strong>) for MySQL, which is an offering from <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), and the <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> for configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>Developer uses <strong class="bold">large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>), which by nature are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers/code blocks shown in the code snapshots. Try to update prompts to get your desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer/code should meet the requirements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>SQL auto-code generation for DBAs using Amazon 
Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, assume <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>a new <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>DBA is planning to work with Amazon RDS for MySQL and does not have any background in this service offering. Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate DBAs, where they can simply ask questions in natural language to learn about DBA activities and best practices when it comes to Amazon RDS for MySQL.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Amazon RDS for MySQL basics for DBAs</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>first learn about Amazon RDS for <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>MySQL:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is Amazon RDS for MySQL ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.1 – Chat style – DBA Amazon RDS for MySQL basic" src="img/B21378_07_1.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2 – Chat style – Amazon RDS for basic MySQL DBA activities</p>
			<p>We will not <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>dive deep into each DBA activity suggested by Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>Q Developer; just note that Amazon Q Developer utilized the key areas of responsibilities of a DBA, such as creating and managing databases, monitoring and optimizing performance, backup and recovery, high availability and replication, security management, and upgrading and patching to provide Amazon RDS with MySQL-specific information. In addition, it also provided resources that can be used for further reading.</p>
			<p>Security management is one of the most important responsibilities of DBAs. Managed AWS services such as Amazon RDS have mechanisms that differ from on-premises databases, so it’s essential that DBAs understand these differences. Let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to provide more information to help DBAs understand specific details and best practices.</p>
			<p>To illustrate the best practice recommendations, we’ll ask Amazon Q Developer about key security <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>resource configurations, such as security groups for <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>Amazon RDS for MySQL databases.</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3 – Chat style – Amazon RDS for MySQL security group best practices</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided the top 10 best practices that DBAs can follow to configure security groups for Amazon RDS for MySQL.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>SQL generation for DBAs</h2>
			<p>Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>ask Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>about the common SQL commands used by Amazon RDS for MySQL DBAs:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Which are the common SQL commands used by Amazon RDS for MySQL DBA?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.4 – Chat style – an Amazon RDS for MySQL common SQL command" src="img/B21378_07_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4 – Chat style – an Amazon RDS for MySQL common SQL command</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding screenshot, the Amazon Q Developer chat-style interface provides multiple commonly used SQL commands with syntax to make it easy to understand. New Amazon RDS for MySQL DBAs will realize that while some traditional DBA activities are managed by Amazon RDS, activities such as creating databases and schemas, simple tables, and database users with specific access permissions still require DBA attention.</p>
			<p>So, based on the preceding information for DBAs, let’s start writing SQL commands to carry out common DBA tasks with Amazon Q Developer’s help. To illustrate, I am going to use the VS Code script editor window with single-line and multi-line prompts.</p>
			<p>Let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to provide a SQL command to create a database and schema:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* Write a SQL command for Amazon RDS for MySQL to
create database "my_test_db", schema "my_test_db.my_test_schema"

			<p>As illustrated here, by using Amazon RDS for MySQL, a DBA can simply use a chat-style and/or prompt-style interface to interact with Amazon Q Developer, receiving error-free SQL code to carry out daily activities. To explore further, feel free to use additional prompts to get SQL code from Amazon Q Developer related to DBA activities.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>next section, let’s see how Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>Developer can help a DE who is mainly responsible for writing SQL code to understand data, join multiple tables, manipulate data, and load data into tables.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>SQL auto-code generation for DEs using Amazon 
Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>assume that <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>a new DE is planning to work with Amazon RDS for MySQL and does not have any background in the SQL command offerings. In the next sections, we will explore how Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>can support DEs with common <strong class="bold">Data Manipulation Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">DML</strong>) support, syntaxes, and basic SQL queries. Let’s start with basic DML support.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Amazon RDS for MySQL basics for DEs</h2>
			<p>Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate DEs, where they can simply <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>ask questions in a natural language to <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>learn about the available commands and functions for Amazon RDS for MySQL. Since data manipulation is a crucial activity for DEs, which falls under a DML, let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to provide information on the support offered by Amazon RDS for DML operations:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What are supported SQL DML commands in Amazon RDS for MySQL?</pre>			<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provides commonly used available SQL commands such as <strong class="bold">SELECT</strong>, <strong class="bold">INSERT</strong>, <strong class="bold">UPDATE</strong>, and <strong class="bold">DELETE</strong>.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.10 – Chat style – Amazon RDS for MySQL DMLs for a DE" src="img/B21378_07_10.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.10 – Chat style – Amazon RDS for MySQL DMLs for a DE</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>SQL generation for DEs</h2>
			<p>Let’s dive deeper and ask about the SQL commands, working with some of the common SQL <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>operations to understand how Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>Q Developer can help DEs learn more, as well as auto-generate SQL code using different prompting techniques.</p>
			<p>Let’s ask one more question about SQL syntax before we start writing SQL code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is syntax of SELECT SQL commands in Amazon RDS for MySQL ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.11 – Chat style – an Amazon RDS for MySQL SELECT command for a DE" src="img/B21378_07_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.11 – Chat style – an Amazon RDS for MySQL SELECT command for a DE</p>
			<p>Note that <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>Amazon Q Developer provided detailed clauses and a <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>sample example at the end to help users understand the usage of the <code>select</code> command.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s start writing SQL commands to carry out common DE tasks with Amazon Q Developer’s help. To illustrate, I am going to use the VS Code script editor window with single-line and multi-line prompts.</p>
			<p>Let’s start with simple <code>select</code> commands from tables, assuming that tables are already present and the user has access to select from them:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* Write a SQL command for Amazon RDS for MySQL to
select sample 10 records from
Table "table_emp" and Table "table_dept"
*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.12 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL select SQL command for a DE" src="img/B21378_07_12.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL select SQL command for a DE</p>
			<p>Now, let’s join these two tables to de-normalize the data, by using <code>join</code>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* Write a SQL command for Amazon RDS for MySQL to join
Table "table_emp" - columns emp_id as integer, emp_name as varchar 50  with Table "table_dept" - columns emp_id as integer, dept_id as int, and dept_name as varchar 50
on emp_id to pull emp_id, emp_name, dept_name
and pull all records from table_emp
*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.13 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL join SQL command for a DE" src="img/B21378_07_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.13 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL join SQL command for a DE</p>
			<p>Note the <code>pull all records from table_emp</code> instruction in our prompt, which Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>Developer correctly converted to <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> between two tables.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>use prompts to create a “store procedure” with output from the preceding join to load into an existing table:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* Write a SQL command for Amazon RDS for MySQL to create Store Procedure  to
Join between Table "table_emp" and Table "table_dept"
on emp_id to pull uppercase(emp_id), emp_name, dept_name

load data into table "derom_data"
*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.14 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL join SQL command for DE" src="img/B21378_07_14.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.14 – A prompt for an Amazon RDS for MySQL join SQL command for DE</p>
			<p>Note that <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>Amazon Q Developer created error-free code to create a “procedure” based on our instructions, and it also added the appropriate function to handle uppercase instructions for <code>emp_id</code>.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>preceding examples, we just scratched the surface of Amazon Q Developer’s integration for SQL code development. Feel free to try different questions in chat-style prompts and interactive coding to explore further.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s explore how the Amazon Q Developer supports code explainability and optimization for SQL.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>SQL code explainability and optimization using Amazon 
Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>Developer offers a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>interface to achieve code explainability and optimization. For more details on the explainability and optimization topic, refer to <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<p>To illustrate, I am going to use the previously auto-generated code during the store procedure creation task. As shown in the following screenshot, highlight the code section generated during the store procedure, right-click to open the pop-up menu, select <strong class="bold">Amazon Q</strong>, and then choose <strong class="bold">Explain</strong> for code explainability or <strong class="bold">Optimize</strong> for optimization recommendations.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.15 –SQL code explainability and optimization" src="img/B21378_07_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.15 –SQL code explainability and optimization</p>
			<p>This will <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>pop up Amazon Q Developer’s <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>chat-style interface and use the full code for analysis.</p>
			<p>For explainability, Amazon Q Developer provides details for almost every line of code and at the end provides a summary, such as the following: “<strong class="bold">When the join_emp_dept stored procedure is called, it will execute the SELECT statement, which performs a left outer join between the table_emp and table_dept tables based on the emp_id column. The resulting data, including the employee ID in uppercase, employee name, and department name, will be inserted into the </strong><strong class="bold">derom_data table</strong><strong class="bold">”</strong>.</p>
			<p>For optimization, even though we had a small code fragment with relatively simple logic, Amazon Q Developer still provided recommendations to improve the code and rewrite it, following the best practices on <code>join</code> implementation, added column listing to the <code>insert</code> statement, added <code>coalesce</code>, and so on.</p>
			<p>As we can see in the preceding topics, Amazon Q Developer provides meaningful inputs for DBAs and Des, with auto-generated SQL for relational databases such as Amazon RDS MySQL. Additionally, Amazon Q Developer seamlessly integrates with columnar databases <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>such as Amazon Redshift. AWS <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>has integrated Amazon Redshift, a fully managed AI-powered data warehouse service, with a code assistant <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>that allows users to use <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) to generate complete SQL queries. We will explore this topic in <a href="B21378_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor210"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a> in the <em class="italic">Code assistance integration with Amazon </em><em class="italic">Redshift</em> section.</p>
			<p>In addition to SQL, Amazon Q Developer supports several other programming languages. There are many developments happening in this area, and we anticipate several of these in support of additional languages (check the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of the chapter).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Summary</h1>
