- en: 'In this third part of the book, we’ll look at building a recommendation application
    using the Spring AI and LangChain4j frameworks. We will look at leveraging LLMs
    and GraphRAG to enhance the graph to lay the foundation for building better recommendation
    applications. We will further enhance the graph by leveraging Graph Data Science
    algorithms such as KNN similarity and community detection to augment the graph
    to deliver better recommendations. We will also take a look at how using these
    algorithms is the better approach over basic vector search. This part of the book
    includes the following chapters:'
