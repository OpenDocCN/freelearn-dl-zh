			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Chapter 5</em>: Backing Up the Code with Git and SD Card Copies</h1>
			<p>As you create and customize the code for your robot, you will invest many hours in getting it to do awesome things that, unless you take precautions, could all suddenly disappear. The programs are not the whole story, as you've already started configuring Raspberry Pi OS for use on the robot. You want to keep your code and config in case of disaster, and to be able to go back if you make changes you regret.</p>
			<p>This chapter will help you understand how exactly code or configuration can break and the disasters you might face while customizing code for your robot. We'll then take a look at three strategies for preventing this.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding how code can be broken or lost</li>
				<li>Strategy 1 – Keeping the code on a PC and uploading it</li>
				<li>Strategy 2 – Using Git to go back in time</li>
				<li>Strategy 3 – Making SD card backups</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will require the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Raspberry Pi and the SD card you prepared in the previous chapter</li>
				<li>The USB power supply and cable you used with the Pi</li>
				<li>A Windows, Linux, or macOS computer or laptop, connected to the internet and able to read/write to SD cards</li>
				<li>Software: FileZilla and Git</li>
				<li>On Windows: Win32DiskImager</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Understanding how code can be broken or lost</h1>
			<p>Code and its <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>close cousin, configuration, take time and hard work. Code needs configuration to run, such as Raspberry Pi OS configuration, extra software, and necessary data files. Both need research and learning and to be designed, made, tested, and debugged.</p>
			<p>Many bad situations can lead to the loss of code. These have happened to me a week before taking robots to a show after weeks of work, and I learned the hard way to take this quite seriously. So, what can happen to your code?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>SD card data loss and corruption</h2>
			<p>SD card corruption<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> is when the data on the SD card used to hold your code, Raspberry Pi OS, and anything you've prepared on it gets broken. Files become unreadable, or the card becomes unusable. The information on the SD card can be permanently lost.</p>
			<p>If a Raspberry Pi unexpectedly loses power, the SD card can be damaged, causing data loss. A hot Pi can slowly bake an SD card, damaging it. Visual processing on a Pi is one way it can get hot. SD cards get damaged if something terrible happens electrically to the Pi via the GPIO pins or its power supply. MicroSD cards are also tiny and are quickly lost when not in the Pi. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Changes to the code or configuration</h2>
			<p>We all make mistakes. Coding means trying things out. While some work out, some do not and things break. At those times, you'll want to go back and see what you've changed. You might be able to use differences to find the bug, or if your experiment looks like a dead end, you may want to go back to a known working version.</p>
			<p>You can also render your robot useless with the wrong configuration, such as the Pi not being on the network or booting anymore. An upgrade to system packages may go wrong and lead to code not working or needing extensive changes to the code for it to work again.</p>
			<p>These problems can combine to cause real nightmares. I've seen changes in the code lead a robot to misbehave and damage itself in a way that made the SD card corrupted. I've been updating packages on the operating system when I knocked the power cable out, corrupting the SD card and breaking Raspberry Pi OS 2 weeks before a significant robot event, and it was painful rebuilding it. This was a lesson learned the hard way.</p>
			<p>Back up the code and back up the SD card configuration. Over the rest of this chapter, we'll look at some solutions to keep your robot's software safe from many kinds of disasters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Strategy 1 – Keeping the code on a PC and uploading it</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Secure File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SFTP</strong>) lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> transfer files from a computer to a Pi. This strategy enables you to write code on your computer, then <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>upload it to the Raspberry Pi. You can choose your editor and have the safety of more than one copy. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">But wait – which editor? Editing code requires software designed for this purpose. Recommendations for Python are Mu, Microsoft VS Code, Notepad++, and PyCharm.</p>
			<p>SFTP uses SSH to copy files to and from the Raspberry Pi over the network. So, let's see how to do it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, make yourself a folder on the PC to store your robot code in; for example, <strong class="source-inline">my_robot_project</strong>.</li>
				<li>Inside that folder, make a test file, using your editor, that will just print a bit of text. Put this code into a file named <strong class="source-inline">hello.py</strong>:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">print("Raspberry Pi is alive")</strong></p></li>
				<li>We will copy this to the robot and run it. You can make the copy using the SFTP tool FileZilla from <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">https://filezilla-project.org</a>. Download this and follow the <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>installation instructions:<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_01.jpg" alt="" width="1650" height="1005"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – FileZilla</p></li>
				<li>Plug in and power up your Raspberry Pi. You will notice at the bottom of the right-hand panel (<em class="italic">Figure 5.1</em>), FileZilla says <strong class="bold">Not connected</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Host</strong> box, type the local hostname you gave your robot Pi in the headless setup, prefixed with <strong class="source-inline">sftp://</strong>; for example, <strong class="source-inline">sftp://myrobot.local</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Username</strong> box, type <strong class="source-inline">pi</strong>, and in the <strong class="bold">Password</strong> box, enter the password you set up before. </li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Quickconnect</strong> button to connect to the Raspberry Pi.</li>
				<li>When <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>connected, you'll see files on the Raspberry Pi in the right-hand <strong class="bold">Remote site</strong> panel, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em>:<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_02.jpg" alt="" width="1177" height="752"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – The Raspberry Pi connected</p></li>
				<li>Use the left-hand <strong class="bold">Local site</strong> panel to go to your code on your computer. </li>
				<li>Now click <strong class="source-inline">hello.py</strong>, highlighted at the top left of <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>, and drag it to the lower right-hand panel to put it on the Raspberry Pi:<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_03.jpg" alt="" width="1650" height="473"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Transferring a file</p></li>
				<li>When you drag the file over, you should see it in the <strong class="bold">Queued files</strong> section, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>. Since this file is small, it will only be in this queued state for an instant. You can also use the same system for whole folders. You'll soon see the file over in the remote site (the Raspberry Pi), shown on the right-hand panel in <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>. </li>
				<li>To run this <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>code, use PuTTY to log in to the Pi and try the following command:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">pi@myrobot:~ $ python3 hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Raspberry Pi is alive</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This strategy is a great start to making code safer. By working on your laptop/PC and copying to the Pi, you've guaranteed there is always one copy other than the one on the robot. You've also got the ability to use any code editor you like on the PC and spot some errors before they even get to the Raspberry Pi. Now we have a copy, let's see how we can track changes to our code and see what we've changed.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Strategy 2 – Using Git to go back in time</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Git</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>popular form of source control, a way to keep a history of changes you've made to code. You can go back through changes, see what they were, restore older versions, and keep a commented log of why you made the changes. Git also lets you store code in more than one location in case your hard drive fails. Git stores code and its history in repositories, or repos. In Git, you can make branches, copies of the whole set of code, to try ideas in parallel with your code, and later merge those back to the main branch. </p>
			<p>I will get you started, but this <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>section can only scratch the surface of what you can do with Git. Let's begin:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Install Git, by following the instructions at <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a> for your computer. <p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">If you are using Windows or macOS, I would suggest using the GitHub app for easier setup. </p></li>
				<li>Git requires you to set your identity using a command line on your computer:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git config --global user.name "&lt;Your Name&gt;"</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git config --global user.email &lt;your email address&gt;</strong></p></li>
				<li>To put this project under source control, we need to initialize it and commit our first bit of code. Make sure you are in the folder for your code (<strong class="source-inline">my_robot_project</strong>) in a command line on your computer and type the following:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git init .</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/danny/workspace/my_robot_project/.git/</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git add hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git commit -m "Adding the starter code"</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">[master (root-commit) 11cc8dc] Adding the starter code</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold"> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold"> create mode 100644 hello.py</strong></p><p><strong class="source-inline">git init .</strong> tells Git to make the folder into a Git repository. <strong class="source-inline">git add</strong> tells Git you want to store the <strong class="source-inline">hello.py</strong> file in Git. <strong class="source-inline">git commit</strong> stores this change for later, with <strong class="source-inline">-m &lt;message&gt;</strong> putting a message in the journal. Git responds to show you it succeeded.</p></li>
				<li>We can now see the journal with <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong>:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git log</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">commit 11cc8dc0b880b1dd8302ddda8adf63591bf340fe (HEAD -&gt; master)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Author: Your Name &lt;your@email.com&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Date: &lt;todays date&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Adding the starter code</strong></p></li>
				<li>Now modify the code in <strong class="source-inline">hello.py</strong>, changing it to this:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">import socket</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">print('%s is alive!' % socket.gethostname())</strong></p><p>If you copy this to the Pi using SFTP, this will say <strong class="source-inline">myrobot is alive!</strong> or whatever you set the hostname of your robot to be. However, we are interested in Git behavior. Note – more advanced Git usage could let you use Git to transfer code to the Raspberry Pi, but that is beyond the scope of this chapter. Let's see how this code is different from before: </p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git diff hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">diff --git a/hello.py b/hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">index 3eab0d8..fa3db7c 100644</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">--- a/hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">+++ b/hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">@@ -1 +1,2 @@</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">-print("Raspberry Pi is alive")</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">+import socket</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">+print('%s is alive!' % socket.gethostname())</strong></p><p>The preceding is Git's<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> way of showing the differences. Git interprets the changes as taking away a <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> line, and in its place adding an <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> and then a <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> line. We can add this into Git to make a new version, and then use <strong class="source-inline">git log</strong> again to see both versions:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git add hello.py</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git commit -m "Show the robot hostname"</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">[master 912f4de] Show the robot hostname</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold"> 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&gt; git log</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">commit 912f4de3fa866ecc9d2141e855333514d9468151 (HEAD -&gt; master)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Author: Your Name &lt;your@email.com&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Date: &lt;the time of the next commit&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Show the robot hostname</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">commit 11cc8dc0b880b1dd8302ddda8adf63591bf340fe (HEAD -&gt; master)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Author: Your Name &lt;your@email.com&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Date: &lt;todays date&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Adding the starter code</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this method, you can go back to previous versions, or just compare versions, and protect yourself against changes you might regret. However, we have only just scratched the surface of the power of Git. See the reference in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section on how to branch, use remote services, roll back to previous versions, and find tools to browse the code in the Git history. </p>
			<p>Now we can go back and forward in time (at least for our code), we can be more confident in making changes. Just remember to make commits frequently – especially after making something work! Next, we will look at how to keep the configuration and installed packages.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Strategy 3 – Making SD card backups</h1>
			<p>Git and SFTP are great for<a id="_idIndexMarker218"/> keeping code safe, but they don't help you reinstall and reconfigure Raspberry Pi OS on a card. The procedures for Windows, Linux, and macOS are quite different for this. The basic idea is to insert the SD card and use a tool to clone the whole card to a file known as an image, which you can restore with balenaEtcher when you need recovery. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You should only restore images to cards of the same size or larger. Putting an image on a smaller device is likely to fail to write, creating a corrupt SD card.</p>
			<p>Before we begin, properly shut down your Raspberry Pi, take out its SD card, and put that into your computer. These clean images are large, so do not put them in your Git repository. It's beyond the scope of this chapter, but I recommend finding a way to compress these files as they <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>are mostly empty right now. In all cases, expect this operation to take 20-30 minutes due to the image sizes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Windows</h2>
			<p>For Windows, we'll use Win32DiskImager. So, our first<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> step will be to install and set this up. Follow along:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Get an installer for this at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager">https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager</a>. </li>
				<li>Run this and follow the installation instructions. <p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Since we will use it immediately, I suggest leaving the <strong class="bold">Launch immediately</strong> checkbox ticked.</p></li>
				<li>Highlighted on the right of <em class="italic">Figure 5.4</em> is the <strong class="bold">Device</strong>; this should have automatically found the SD card device. Use the folder icon highlighted to choose where the image file will be stored:<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_04.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="482"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Win32 Disk Imager</p></li>
				<li>In <em class="italic">Figure 5.5</em>, I name my image <strong class="source-inline">myrobot.img</strong> in the <strong class="bold">File name</strong> box. You then click the <strong class="bold">Open</strong> button to confirm this:<div id="_idContainer066" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_05.jpg" alt="" width="1618" height="791"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Choose the location</p></li>
				<li>After clicking <strong class="bold">Open</strong>, you'll<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> see a screen like the left side of <em class="italic">Figure 5.6</em> with your selected location in the <strong class="bold">Image File</strong> box. Click on the <strong class="bold">Read</strong> button to start copying the image. As it reads the image, you'll see a progress bar and an estimation of the time remaining. When the image is done, Win32 Disk Imager will tell you that the read was successful, and you can then exit the software:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15660_05_06.jpg" alt="" width="979" height="268"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Reading the image</p>
			<p>You have now created a <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>complete copy of the data on the SD card. If you have corruption or configuration issues, you can write this image back to an SD card to restore it to this point.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Mac</h2>
			<p>MacOS X has a built-in way <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>to make SD card and disk images. This is by using the built-in Disk Utility tool. Let's see how this works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start the <strong class="bold">Disk Utility</strong> tool. When loaded, it should look like <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em>:<div id="_idContainer068" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_07.jpg" alt="" width="1421" height="876"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – The Disk Utility tool</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>to show <em class="italic">Figure 5.8</em>:<div id="_idContainer069" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_08.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="212"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – The View menu</p></li>
				<li>Now click on the <strong class="bold">Show All Devices</strong> option.</li>
				<li>You should now see the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>. Select the device that contains a boot volume: <div id="_idContainer070" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_09.jpg" alt="" width="1412" height="728"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – Disk Utility with Show All Devices enabled</p></li>
				<li>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>menu bar, select <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Image</strong> (<em class="italic">Figure 5.10</em>):<div id="_idContainer071" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_10.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="170"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – New Image menu</p></li>
				<li>Under this, select <strong class="bold">Image from &lt;your storage device&gt;</strong> (<em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em>):<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_11.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="206"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Image from STORAGE DEVICE</p></li>
				<li>Disk Utility will <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>show a dialog (<em class="italic">Figure 5.12</em>). Set the file name and location, and <strong class="bold">Format</strong> to <strong class="bold">DVD/CD master</strong>:<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_12.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="516"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Save dialog</p></li>
				<li>Disk Utility gives these files a <strong class="source-inline">.cdr</strong> extension (<em class="italic">Figure 5.13</em>):<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_13.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="235"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – File with .cdr extension</p></li>
				<li>Rename this to a <strong class="source-inline">.iso</strong>:<div id="_idContainer075" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15660_05_14.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="198"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14 – Renamed to .iso</p></li>
				<li>You will need to <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>confirm you want this (<em class="italic">Figure 5.15</em>):</li>

			<p>You are now able to create SD images ready to use with balenaEtcher on macOS.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Linux</h2>
			<p>Backing up SD cards is done on the <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>command line in Linux by using the <strong class="source-inline">dd</strong> command. Before we see how this works, we will first need to find the device's location. Let's begin:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Insert the card and type the following to find the device's location:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ dmesg</strong></p></li>
				<li>This command will output a lot of stuff, but you are interested only in a line near the end that looks like the following:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk</strong></p><p>The card is in the square brackets, <strong class="source-inline">[sdb]</strong>, which may be different on your computer. The SD card location will be <strong class="source-inline">/dev/&lt;drive location&gt;</strong>, for example, <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb</strong>. </p><p class="callout-heading">Important note</p><p class="callout">Be careful to get the locations right, as you could destroy the contents of an SD card or your computer hard drive. If you are at all unsure, <strong class="bold">do not</strong> use this method.</p></li>
				<li>Once you have the SD location (such as <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">/dev/disk1</strong>), you can then start the clone with the <strong class="source-inline">dd</strong> command. This command dumps data to and from drives:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=~/myrobot.img bs=32M</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Password:</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">474+2 records in</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">474+2 records out</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">15931539456 bytes (16 GB, 15 GiB) copied, 4132.13 s, 3.9 MB/s</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> parameter is the <strong class="bold">input file</strong>, which in this case is your SD card. The <strong class="source-inline">of</strong> parameter is the <strong class="bold">output file</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">myrobot.img</strong> file you are cloning your card into.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">bs</strong> parameter is the <strong class="bold">block size</strong>, so making this large, such as <strong class="source-inline">32M</strong>, will make the operation quicker.</p>
			<p>You will need to type your user password for this to start. The <strong class="source-inline">dd</strong> command creates the <strong class="source-inline">myrobot.img</strong> file as a clone of the whole SD card in your home directory. <strong class="source-inline">dd</strong> will give no output until it is complete, and will then show you stats about the operation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you have learned how to look after your code and configuration. You have seen how things can go wrong, and the strategies to protect your work from them. You have a starting point with Git, SFTP, and SD card backups that you can use together to be a bit more experimental and fearless about changes to your robot. You can use SFTP to edit on your computer, giving you at least one copy other than the code on your robot and letting you use powerful editors. You can use Git to go back in time, so you can wind back from mistakes and experiments, or just see the differences. You can use SD card backups to get a complete image of the storage your Raspberry Pi is using, and restore it if it goes wrong.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll start to build a basic robot. We'll assemble the robot chassis with motors and wheels, determine what power systems to use, then test fit the overall shape of our robot. Bring a screwdriver!</p>

				<li>Try creating a file on your computer – a simple image or text. Try using SFTP to send it to the Raspberry Pi, then, using PuTTY, see if you can list the file with the <strong class="source-inline">ls</strong> command. The file could be a simple Python script, which you could try running on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
				<li>Make a change that is incorrect to <strong class="source-inline">hello.py</strong>. Use <strong class="source-inline">diff</strong> to see the difference. Use Git resources (see the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section) to find out how to return this to how it was before the change.</li>
				<li>Make a backup of your Raspberry Pi SD card using the preceding instructions, make some changes to the data in <strong class="source-inline">/home/pi</strong>, then restore the image using balenaEtcher. You could even restore your backup to another SD card, and plug it into the Raspberry Pi as if it was the original.</li>
				<li>I recommend finding out more about how Git can be used to look after your code, and even as a method of getting code onto the Raspberry Pi. Use the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section to find out more about Git, and ways to work it into your coding workflow. Git can be complicated, but it is a tool worth learning.</li>
