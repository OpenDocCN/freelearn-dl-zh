- en: Too often, technical literature is filled with long code listings, shallow explanations,
    and concepts that barely scratch the surface. This book is a deliberate departure
    from that trend. Here, you’ll find not just code but context—explanations, rationales,
    and practical examples that take you far beyond what a library’s documentation
    might offer.

- en: Why spaCy? spaCy is one of the most powerful and versatile NLP libraries available
    today. It has gained prominence for its speed, ease of use, and adaptability to
    a wide range of applications, from academic research to enterprise-level solutions.
    But the true potential of spaCy is unlocked only when you move past basic usage
    and dive deep into its architecture, capabilities, and extensibility. This book
    is designed to be your guide on that journey.

- en: What sets this book apart is a focus on real-world applicability. From the very
    beginning, we’ll focus on creating concrete NLP workflows and components, tackling
    tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, and training custom **Named
    Entity Recognition** ( **NER** ) models. You’ll learn not only how to use spaCy’s
    core features but also how to incorporate **Large Language Models** ( **LLMs**
    ) and use the latest tools for data and model management.

- en: Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or an NLP enthusiast, this book aims
    to make complex topics accessible, engaging, and—most importantly—useful. We’ll
    go step by step through the spaCy features and turn them into actionable skills
    that you can apply to your own projects.
