			<p class="calibre3">One of the secrets of successful development efforts is to work on the proper work. The agile method helps break down effort into manageable pieces, but some concepts, like Estimating Poker (we will explain), focus on the <em class="italic">cost</em> of doing the work, not the <em class="italic">value</em>. We want to share a method to systematically break down stories so they can be prioritized based on the value to the customer. ChatGPT solutions require a lot of decision-making. We need to prioritize those decisions. Adding or editing knowledge, doing more testing, adding a new integration, changing the models, improving fine-tuning, or refining prompts must all be prioritized. It might seem obvious, but work on the work that provides the most value as soon as possible. Items that hold little value or benefit a small subset of customers could wait. We have a way of putting this backlog of work into an order the team can understand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We will discuss the concept of <em class="italic">User Needs Scoring</em> in-depth and tie it to the development cost. That will set up <a href="B21964_05_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, Define the Desired (User) Experience.</p>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor087" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Prioritizing the backlog</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">First, some context <a id="_idIndexMarker194" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>and history. A <strong class="bold">backlog</strong> means the collection of known work to be evaluated by the team for development. The closer an item on the backlog is to being worked, the more detail is needed to understand and scope it. This is why we have different approaches to managing items on this list of work. Sometimes, a large team will have many sprint teams, each managing its backlog of work. However, since all teams are<a id="_idIndexMarker195" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> marching toward the same goals, it is essential to understand that everyone is working on the backlog with the most value. We will be better off having a repeatable and consistent understanding of what work to do first. <strong class="bold">Weighted shortest job first</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSJF</strong>) is one of these ways.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor088" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>WSJF</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The agile concept of WSJF<a id="_idIndexMarker196" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> helps one decide which job/task/project/feature/content<a id="_idIndexMarker197" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> should be given resources to complete first.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We learn that the most critical tasks don’t always come first because their value depends on the development cost. Sometimes, doing something different on the backlog can provide better value for the development investment (in the USA, we call this getting a <em class="italic">good bang for your buck</em>—a buck is another term for a US dollar).</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I had a great Agile teacher who explained this the best and will try to do it justice. WSJF prioritizes work based on the <strong class="bold">cost of delay</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoD</strong>) <em class="italic">to the customer</em>. Customers don’t get any<a id="_idIndexMarker198" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> value from features that don’t ship. Shipping the most valuable features sooner minimizes the CoD. However, for two features of equal value, deliver the one with the least cost first. Why? Because the customer gets the value from the product sooner rather than waiting for the more costly feature.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s examine <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.1</em>, from the <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile </strong><strong class="bold">Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>).</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Explaining the CoD</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">WSJF</a> (<a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the SAFe, this example is based on item C having a small CoD. However, because of its long time to complete it, its development blocks getting value from delivering B and A, represented in the <em class="italic">Low WSJF First</em> graphic with their <code>1.0</code> and <code>0.1</code> WSJF values. Consider that CoD is an unrealized value that can’t be recovered. Instead, take the <em class="italic">High WSJF First</em> example, where A is done, B, and then C. Now, because A contains a high CoD and is first, there isn’t as much remaining CoD. Customers get value sooner. Less value is wasted, like in the <em class="italic">Low WSJF</em> example, where we delivered C first.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This allows for comparing features in the backlog needed by the generative AI product. Let’s try an example with two features: password reset support and ordering a replacement part. Suppose they are of equal value to the customer (and we will go deep into how to calculate their value later). Which one should be done first?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Password reset takes 45 days to develop, while the replacement part feature takes 90 days. The team can only work on one feature due to staffing. If the password reset feature ships, customers get 45 days of value before the replacement part feature would have shipped. They get value from this feature starting on day 46.After 135 days and the completion of both features, the customer enjoys 90 days of value from the reset feature. Had they completed the replacement part feature first, they would have only received 45 days of value from both features combined. By changing the order of development, the customer effectively doubled the value.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I find it challenging to wrap my head around negative words in the CoD. The CoD happens because the work is holding off delivery to the customer and can’t provide value to the customers until it ships. Doing this effectively assumes a cost of development estimate. We can all agree that estimating is hard. All development teams know this. The relative cost <em class="italic">is reasonable</em> to compare with consistent costing across features. We will make estimation errors. For Agile Scrum teams, use the retrospective at the end of each sprint to continually improve estimating costs.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The CoD is focused on the cost to a consumer. The size of the CoD is a function of the delay in the customer getting value. Delaying a more valuable job to deliver a less valuable job incurs a more significant CoD.</p>
			<p class="callout"><em class="italic">CoD is the money lost by delaying or not </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker199" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/></em><em class="italic">doing a job for a specific time.

			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.2</em> from the Scaled Agile<a id="_idIndexMarker200" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> website shows that the CoD model has some user-centric elements.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">After talking with the Scaled Agile team, we adopted a different approach that can offer similar value. Implementing a repeatable, trainable process that provides consistent results is the most important thing to <a id="_idIndexMarker201" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>consider. A <strong class="bold">rubric</strong>, a set of criteria, and descriptions create a consistent method for judgment. This makes it easier for people outside of the team to understand and easier to appreciate than the traditional CoD.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Reinertsen’s book is genius for improving development processes:</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Book: <a href="https://amzn.to/3A3u34C" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">The Principles of Product Development Flow</a> by Donald Reinertsen (<a href="https://amzn.to/3A3u34C" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://amzn.to/3A3u34C</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The book is precious for those who want to understand development processes beyond WSJF. In enterprise development, the SAFe is a well-thought-out, robust, and mature model to support Agile across large organizations. I strongly encourage exploration and deep dives into what is available.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">With the basics <a id="_idIndexMarker203" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>of WSJF, go away knowing there is value in delivering equivalency in a shorter period. However, not all features are equal. We propose a new method to calculate a user-centric version of the CoD. It is called the <strong class="bold">User Needs </strong><strong class="bold">Score</strong> (<strong class="bold">UNS</strong>).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor089" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>User Needs Scoring</h2>
			<p class="callout-heading">The UNS is a user-centric approach to the CoD, accounting for the scope, frequency, and severity of a problem or feature.</p>
			<p class="callout">UNS is <a id="_idIndexMarker204" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>based on the fine work uncovered in Bruce Tognazzini’s book <em class="italic">Tog on Design</em> (1992), which Phil Haine shared with me while working as a consultant. I then took<a id="_idIndexMarker205" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> this work and adapted it into the numerator for the WSJF calculation.</p>
			<p class="callout">Tog’s book referenced a study by Robin Jeffries et al. that evaluated different techniques for finding usability problems, including heuristic evaluation and guidelines, which we will cover in <a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines and Heuristics</em> usability testing (<a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em>), and cognitive walkthrough (a solid technique).</p>
			<p class="callout">Article: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/108844.108862" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">User Interface Evaluation in the Real World: Comparison of Four Techniques</a> by Robin Jeffries et. al. (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/108844.108862" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/108844.108862</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In Jeffries’s study, the participants were asked to analyze issues to “take into account the impact of the problem, the frequency with which it would be encountered, and the relative number of users that would be affected.” They used a metric ranging from 1 (trivial) to 9 (critical). We will build on this concept with a more repeatable way to score.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The official CoD from SAFe is user-business value + time criticality + risk reduction and/or opportunity engagement, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.2</em>. The elements of the CoD make sense; do work benefiting customers (user-business value), have value in delivering sooner rather than later (time criticality), and help change the playing field by reducing risk.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We need a consistent and repeatable metric that non-experts can easily explain and repeat. The approach is<a id="_idIndexMarker206" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to follow three similar metrics and provide rubrics that can be applied consistently.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is the User Needs Scoring model. This score will be for the feature/bug fix/enhancement and will be the numerator in our WSJF calculation:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Scope</strong>: How many users does it impact? (3 – All, 2 – Some, 1 – A few or a limited role)</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Frequency</strong>: How often is it used? (3 – Always, 2 – Sometimes, 1 – Infrequently)</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Severity</strong>: How bad is the problem? (4 – Severe, 3 – Critical, 2 – Important, 1 – Minor Importance)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">We then model the CoD as <em class="italic">scope</em> times <em class="italic">frequency</em> times <em class="italic">severity</em>. This means the values range from 1 (1*1*1) to 36 (3*3*4). We will explain each value and how to score with many examples so anyone can apply this model.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Scoring the user value and dividing it by the cost brings both sides of the discussion into play. Scores can be compared between teams, and in SAFe, they can be used to get stories that other teams need to complete into a fair and manageable order (or at least to have the discussion). Whatever is <em class="italic">most important</em> is scored highest in WSJF and should be done first. We do this ordering by scoring each item. This is more repeatable than just <em class="italic">moving things around</em> in an Agile tracking tool until it looks right.</p>

			<p class="calibre3"><img src="img/3.png" alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;U&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;D&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" class="calibre21"/></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can adopt an approach that Agile teams use to evaluate these UNS estimates, which might vary between team members. In Agile, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker207" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a concept called <strong class="bold">Estimating Poker</strong>. The idea is to independently calculate the cost of a feature and then discuss why the values were selected when they are different. This helps uncover unknown elements that a member might not have considered. We can apply the same approach to estimating user needs and continue to do this for development costs.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In Estimating Poker, team members can collaboratively review and discuss the UNS, and we expose gaps in our understanding and<a id="_idIndexMarker208" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> expectations. Two to three people must compare estimates to judge the UNS. This will teach the team how to do this scoring. One person can score alone but will miss the value of other people’s perspectives. A simple scoring method on a one to three scale makes it more likely to agree. However, the poker method is there to help communicate and clarify differences and come to a consensus when disagreements occur. The score will also help decide whether a bug should be fixed before adding a new feature. Going through many examples will make this method more straightforward.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor090" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Scoring enterprise solutions</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The best way to learn<a id="_idIndexMarker209" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> how to create a scoring method is to try doing the scoring method. We provide the rules, show examples from typical enterprise applications, and coach through how to score some tricky stories. Then, <a id="_idIndexMarker210" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>practice with your own stories.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre11">How to score items</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">First, the <em class="italic">wrong way</em> to prioritize a backlog.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Look at a list and see which ones the product owner thinks should be done first; consider the ones where the developers can do it quickly. Another common mistake comes from the strongest-willed team member who speaks the loudest to get their work to rise to the top. This is what we want to avoid. An unbiased approach to scoring stories allows the value of the story to drive the need. The story’s value should speak for itself. Stories might match use cases from the previous chapter or be software bugs. Sometimes, use cases are broken down into multiple stories to complete a story in a sprint. For our discussion, the story is the piece of the use case we plan on delivering in a development period.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The <em class="italic">right way</em> is to use an <em class="italic">unbiased</em> method to put the items in order using a three-step rating system. Anyone knowledgeable about the stories can generate a score. Hopefully, product owners, designers, engineers, or other related team members can do this and then discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker211" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>and resolve things that all parties haven’t considered. This is done by answering the following questions. We will back up these criteria and levels of performance with many examples and descriptions for each score:</p>
			<ol class="calibre12">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Scope</strong>: How many users does it impact? Answer with a score from 3 to 1.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Frequency</strong>: How often is it used? Answer with a score from 3 to 1.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Severity</strong>: How bad is the problem? Answer with a score from 4 to 1.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Calculate each item’s score by multiplying them (e.g., 3*2*2 = 12).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Order stories by the score. As new stories come in, score them. They will naturally fall into the correct order of user value.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Development estimates the cost of these stories.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Divide the score by that estimated cost. Generally, work down from the most significant user needs scoring items.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">If something costs too much, it is a candidate to break down into smaller stories.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="calibre11">How to score consistently</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">By learning some simple rules, independent<a id="_idIndexMarker212" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> people with a shared understanding of the scores should be able to score the same item similarly. However, differences will exist. Let someone else score the same story, and if they come up with a different score, discuss why. Reaching a joint agreement occurs nine times out of ten. If there is confusion about the scope of the problem, someone is likely underestimating it. Scope rarely shrinks over time, so go conservative. Use the larger value. We will drill down into the rubrics for each score in the UNS. I have seen teams split the difference (they can’t decide on a 2 or 3, so they score 2.5). This is an option, but this hedging approach is typically unnecessary. One needs to ensure the story tracking tool supports this. I developed integrations with Jira and Oracle’s internal bug system to use drop menus to make it easier to select whole numbers. However, we appreciate not wasting <a id="_idIndexMarker213" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>time, so do it when needed. Don’t automatically split the difference with a disagreement. Discuss the reasons behind the scores. We can explain the rubric behind each score.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">When scoring the feature, isolating the dimension being scored is critical. Ignore the other two factors. Score each factor independently of the other two.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre14">Scope – how many users does it impact?</h4>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">3 – All, 2 – Some, 1 – A few or a Limited </em><em class="italic">User Role</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">When considering who this change is made for, think of that group in the context of the total number of customers for the product. It cannot be based only on the people using the specific feature. <em class="italic">Everyone</em> signs into a secure portal to access enterprise ChatGPT or other services– so rating problems with sign-in get a score of 3. At the same time, only a few people customize their home page. One could rate that a 1. Don’t change the scope and say, “Well, <em class="italic">within</em> the people who customize, <em class="italic">all</em> of them will use this feature.” It doesn’t work that way. Scores need to be measured against other stories and across different teams. The goal is to determine where the most good would come from by applying resources, so cheating doesn’t help the product. Focus only on the number of users impacted. Ignore Severity and how bad the problem is at this step.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Indeed, being unable to sign in is different than a visual distraction such as the words “sign in” wrapping oddly on a mobile phone. We will handle that in the last user metric.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The enterprise solution might be in a chat interface; parts might be conversational results in hybrid UIs or data rendered from a ChatGPT backend. No matter the form, each can impact a few or many users.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are Scope examples that score as 3s:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Common questions and answers (because “everyone” does this)</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Sign in</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Issues on the landing page that prevent sign-in or registration</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Setting up an account</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Very slow to respond in almost all cases</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Missing the primary use cases</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are Scope <a id="_idIndexMarker214" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>examples that can score as 2s:</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Discuss and debate, but work to score consistently. Sometimes, the term everyone means very close to everyone, such as customers who sign into online banking. However, we know some older adults might avoid online banking, and a few of those who sign in are high-value customers. If all things are equal, there is more value in doing something for all users rather than for a few. Once the number of impacted users is understood, consider how often the issue, task, or action will occur.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre14">Frequency – how often is it used</h4>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">3 – All of the Time, 2 – Sometimes, 1 – </em><em class="italic">Infrequently</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If every time users come here, the problem exists, it is easy to make this a 3. If it only happens in a specific mode or state, then it is a 2, and those annoying errors that pop up rarely would be a 1. Judge whether issues occur sometimes or infrequently because multiplying by one doesn’t do anything. Consider that intermittent errors are challenging to reproduce. If errors are noted in a log analysis or bugs that keep coming up, set this as a 2. There is flexibility, but all the time means all of the time; use a consistent approach to judging between 2s and 1s. If it is less than 5% to 10% of the time, it is a 1. Don’t consider the importance of what is being scored. This will be judged in the third score.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are a few Frequency examples of 3s:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">The answer to the question is always wrong</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Every time a dialog box is opened, it is empty</li>
				<li class="calibre8">A typo or grammar error that appears all of the time</li>
				<li class="calibre8">A scroll bar always appears even when not needed or wanted</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The tone or style of the conversation needs to be corrected</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The chat doesn’t recall the context set in this session</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are some Frequency examples of 2s:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">The answer to a question sometimes needs to be corrected</li>
				<li class="calibre8">If your saved name is too large, then it truncates</li>
				<li class="calibre8">A time-out error appears after using the product for 10 minutes, and this is too early (if the time-out is usually 4 hours)</li>
				<li class="calibre8">A dialog box appears off-screen some of the time</li>
				<li class="calibre8">In many conditions, the style or tone of the conversation needs to be corrected</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The chat doesn’t recall context sometimes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are some Frequency <a id="_idIndexMarker215" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>examples of 1s:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">In a specific use case, the style or tone of the conversation is wrong</li>
				<li class="calibre8">An error appears rarely, and no understanding of why. It only happened once in that session, and everything is working</li>
				<li class="calibre8">When saving a chat session, it errors out on rare occasions</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Every once in a while, when going back in the chat window, it forgets what step we are on and shows the wrong information that was already affirmed</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">When looking at logs, it might not be obvious how often something is happening. It would be best to look at a larger cross-section of logs or test instances to learn about frequency. But it is sometimes more of a judgment call for a two or a one because there is so little data. Remember, this is just frequency; don’t get freaked out because some are bad issues; we should catch that next.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre14">Severity – how bad is the problem?</h4>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">4 – Severe, 3 – Critical, 2 – Important, 1 – </em><em class="italic">Not Important</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">This is the easiest to score, or is it? Severity is sometimes hotly contested. Our values are inverted compared to most organizations’ common Bug Severity (Sev). Because all organizations have Severity, it would seem easy to do. But not always. Our score needs to use larger numbers to express more value. We can break down how people think about Sev and the scores we assign to each severity.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">An actual <strong class="bold">Severity 1</strong> issue only comes up occasionally. Severity 1 means <strong class="bold">service is down – unavailable</strong>, and no workaround. We don’t often see Sev 1s in development because the code is not in production, and thus, the production system isn’t being evaluated. But from a usability perspective, if the task can’t be completed, that is a usability Sev 1 and thus is worth the most, so we assign it the largest value, a 4. Likely, these are just bugs. An organization should have a list of definitions to help prioritize bugs; start with that. If not, create one. I had one printed out by my desk to remind me of classes of bugs and their values. At my previous company, we had a category just below Severity 1 called a <strong class="bold">Severity 2</strong> <strong class="bold">Showstopper</strong>. Because<a id="_idIndexMarker216" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> they were showstoppers, a significant issue that impedes progress, we would also classify these as 4. From there, we go<a id="_idIndexMarker217" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to Sev 2, worth 3 points. It represents critical issues that cause significant user roadblocks. Sev 3 is worth 2 points. These are problems that cause some issues but likely won’t cause the customer to scream and yell. Finally, Sev 4 is assigned 1 point. These are minor issues. Most organizations have the 1 to 4 severity scale, so we have the 4 to 1 values.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Severity is well understood in most organizations; extending the definition to include LLM issues and inverting the values is a good start. If the organization scoring model extends beyond 4, consider mapping it down. Applying a five—or six-point scale for Severity will dramatically increase its weight in the UNS. It’s a choice, but we will discuss the downside of weighting in the UNS calculation later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Severity is well understood for bugs but might not be used for criticality or priority of new features. For our purposes, we use one measure here. Examples consider the issues, stories, features, or interactions in UIs or ChatGPT-enabled solutions. They are just examples to further the conversation.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor091" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Examples of scoring</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Practice to learn the method. To score, we use the UNS values and multiply them together. Then, include development to cost efforts to prioritize and solve these issues.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Dev teams usually start with T-shirt sizing. They estimate the cost of development with <strong class="bold">Extra Small</strong> (<strong class="bold">XS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Small</strong> (<strong class="bold">S</strong>), <strong class="bold">Medium</strong> (<strong class="bold">M</strong>), <strong class="bold">Large</strong> (<strong class="bold">L</strong>), <strong class="bold">Extra Large</strong> (<strong class="bold">XL</strong>), and so on. They must do the math at some point, converting this to story points, a standard unit of measure for Agile development or development days. The Fibonacci sequence is commonly used for this estimation when using numbers. The numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) grow with each gap to convey the complexity of measuring a large project. The larger the estimate, the more significant the gap because more extensive efforts have more variability when estimating. They are commonly used for costing development. Once there are numbers, divide the UNS by the development cost. This is only done once this story is close enough to development that understanding is clear enough to cost it <a id="_idIndexMarker221" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>beyond T-shirt sizing. Development can use a proxy like T-shirt sizing (1-XS, 2-S, 5-M, 8-L, 13-XL, etc.) that the team agrees on. However, do an actual costing exercise to understand better what is being built. <em class="italic">Table 4.1</em> contains some GUI design examples. These examples include conversational issues. Once these stories are understood, development can cost them more accurately.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">It is challenging to get the team to <a id="_idIndexMarker222" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>decide on a costing method; this focus is on a value method. To explore why one uses Fibonacci numbers rather than time in hours or days, learn about story points. After starting with this simple explanation, do some searching.

			<p class="calibre3">There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker223" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>rationale behind the UNS values for each item in <em class="italic">Table 4.1</em>. Because you are unfamiliar with the application, context is provided with each item. We will relate these examples to LLM issues typical in generative AI applications:</p>
			<ol class="calibre12">
				<li class="calibre8">The browser’s back button does not go “back”:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: When building a web application, a process likely goes from one web page to another; it is natural for a user to want to occasionally return to the previous step. So, they click the browser’s back button. Without coding for this, the application fails to navigate correctly.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: Because the user is <em class="italic">lost</em> and can’t return to the main UI, this problem is worth fixing immediately. The tech stack had an issue supporting back, which is why development costs are high. It means rearchitecting how the browser session is created, thus making it a challenge. If the cost is less than twice that of item number two (because its score is half as big), it would still be more valuable to fix item 1 before item 2. When LLM chat is integrated into existing apps, all kinds of issues appear: does the conversation pick up where it left off when opening a new tab or window on the same site? How does the back button in the browser impact the conversation thread? Does the conversation get confused with multiple open windows when the customer interacts in multiple windows?</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Text</strong>: “Run” should be called “Search” in the toolbar:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: We typically see a search field when designing a UI to search a database.

Everyone searches in this app. If the Run label is generated based on a user profile, it might appear only for a segment of the audience and only in some conditions. In this example, it is always on screen and is used all the time, so the Frequency is also a three. When scoring severity, if it causes the wrong interaction, it scores a three; if the text is just confusing, score it a two.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Alternative UI considerations</strong>: If this were a conversational search from a chat prompt, we would train our model to understand various names for our search function (e.g., <strong class="source-inline1">Find me all phone models that have…</strong>, <strong class="source-inline1">What are the phone models with…</strong>, <strong class="source-inline1">List the phone models…</strong>). The default models should pick up this nuance very quickly, but with enterprise-specific tasks, train the model to understand the tasks and the various ways one can ask for them. This will require prompt engineering and fine-tuning, and we will start to cover that in <a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Prompt Engineering</em>.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">Can’t submit a prompt by pressing return in a field:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: There is a similar issue in the ChatGPT playground. They decided that the <em class="italic">return</em> key on the keyboard should be used to create a carriage return in the text entry field. To submit the text, press <em class="italic">command</em> + <em class="italic">return</em> (on a Mac), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>.</li></ul></li>

			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: We understand how folks naturally press return on the keyboard on mobile or desktop to submit a form. They must stop and deal with the onscreen button press when this doesn’t happen. In <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em> from ChatGPT, they have to press two keyboard buttons together. That is annoying and not natural<a id="_idIndexMarker225" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>. Hence, it is a two on the Severity scale. Users will likely <em class="italic">never</em> get used to this interaction because it is unlike the 99% of interactions they already do. An OpenAI interaction designer likely lost this battle, but they did get to include the <em class="italic">command</em> + <em class="italic">return</em> command in the button label. A hack at best, but at least it is a visible reminder. This is an example of a visual affordance covered in <a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines </em><em class="italic">and Heuristics</em>.</li>

It wasn’t just hidden because of an operating system setting, but it didn’t happen to all users (score of 2). It only occurs when there is a lot of text and not all answers are lengthy. However, if the user wants to read the whole answer, the scroll bar not appearing or not being supported is a big issue (scores a 3).

				<li class="calibre8"><em class="italic">Enterprise Support Recommendations</em> is a term that needs to be clarified:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: If terms are unfamiliar to the user base, they might miss important information about their task.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: Customer feedback suggests that this term needs to be clarified. We understand that the results could be written more user-centric and less technical. Some people will understand this term, so it only rates a two. It will always be used; everyone will see it, so it is a three on the <em class="italic">Frequency</em> scale. But there is help, and the term includes keywords such as <em class="italic">support</em> and <em class="italic">recommendation</em>, so the additional word “enterprise” doesn’t add any value; it is not critical. As expected, it is not hard to edit a word, so the cost is XS. Conversational style, tone, and language will likely cause issues. Review <a id="_idIndexMarker226" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>how knowledge and help is written and work to address how an LLM responds using prompt engineering.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">Columnated results need to be sorted correctly:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: The logical order for a list should be the default. If multiple logical orders exist, user control should be allowed, and customer history could be used to decide the default.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: A challenge with data in documents and tables is preserving table-like features. With this, some information is maintained and clear. For example, showing the country’s top 25 college football teams alphabetically isn’t helpful. They should be sorted by their current college rank. The table should include the calendar date for the last ranking (so old data is apparent). However, only some users ask for this kind of data, and if the table is sortable, then there is an easy workaround to ask for the data to be sorted. In this example, we don’t expect sorting for the top 25 teams in football. In <a href="B21964_05_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining the Desired Experience</em>, we will go into detail about the use of tables in small chat windows. The real estate for a table is sometimes tight at best. A table acceptable on a desktop web experience won’t work on a mobile chat experience. In this case, not all users were impacted by the table (a score of 2), but it was always an issue because it was affixed with a poor sort choice (a score of 3). It wasn’t a big issue because of the kind of data (score of 2). Critical data, such as deals likely to close this month, demand a good sort order (deal size, likelihood of closing) and the <a id="_idIndexMarker227" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>ability to change the order using a GUI or conversationally.<p class="calibre3">Sort the deals by closest diving distance to me</p><p class="calibre3">Show the orders by quantity</p><p class="calibre3">Display deals for me that require the most attention that will give me the most commission</p></li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">The default UI language does not match the website:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: <a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines and Heuristics</em> will discuss matching a customer’s language and understanding. If there are different terms to mean the same thing (common in an enterprise), the user might only understand terms within the proper context. This applies to spoken and written languages.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: Respect the customers’ wishes in an international UI. If they have set their UI to Spanish, they should be given their conversational chat or AI results in Spanish. If they have to ask for it in Spanish, <em class="italic">“Español, por favor,”</em> this is a fail. If not all the information is in Spanish, the failure is worse. If the LLM supports multiple languages, how will it react to a combination of two languages? Issues around the choice of words, internationalization, or cultural issues should be evaluated for repair or rework. We will talk about some of this in the next chapter. In this example, most customers work in English, so each primary language scores 2 for customers impacted. They would always have this issue (a 3). Depending on the language and user, the severity is typically a 2. If the user can only work in their native language, and the site doesn’t support it, score this a 4.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">Text and formatted numbers should align correctly:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: Currency, table data, and <strong class="source-inline1">name:value</strong> pairs must be aligned in specific ways.</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: As long as labels and alignment don’t impact understanding, these score smaller values even if they always appear. Decide how vital style and a clean experience are to the company. However, as shown, these are low (XS) costs, so with some work, they will be prioritized accordingly and fixed. Formatting, in general, can be an issue for an LLM. In chat <a id="_idIndexMarker228" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>experiences, the customer might be able to direct the LLM to change the format (e.g., <strong class="source-inline1">show as a table</strong>) or present the findings differently. Improvements to the instructions given to the LLM might be warranted.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">Images don’t have labels:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: When a UI includes images, for example, in search results, they must be labeled with words. It is possible to use an LLM to label these more descriptively than a human would. For example, we might show shoes on a clothing site. “Shoes” is not an uncommon label that a screen reader can read for someone visually impaired. An image analysis LLM might provide the more accurate “Nike tennis shoes with a leather upper, and red, green, and yellow panels on a clear sole with Velcro straps.”</li><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Reasoning</strong>: Depending on the context, images without labels can be more important than just an accessibility concern. In this case, the photos are more ornamental and are supported by text in the conversation. But watch out for this: make sure the experience is accessible and that labels, if generated by the AI, represent a clear understanding of their purpose. Significant images must be described for the visually impaired. GPT 4o can understand and present details for an image. So the user can hear the description and make purchasing decisions. These descriptions are not necessarily shown on screen. A screen reader will pick up the description from the HTML metadata and speak it. This can be done at a lower cost by sending the request for descriptions to the LLM by batch processing and storing the descriptions in the database. Batch processing in ChatGPT saves money. These robust labels can also be fed into the search to enable robust searching without additional LLM costs.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8">A task region cannot be dragged or moved onto the screen:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Background</strong>: Enterprise users have dashboards. Dashboards will get smarter because of LLMs. A little preview: <a href="B21964_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusion</em> will discuss the value of Wisdom, which every dashboard should have. The user tries to add a region that wasn’t<a id="_idIndexMarker229" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> displayed by default. If they go to customize the page and can’t add or move some regions around, they will think this is a bug. <em class="italic">Figure 4.5</em> shows a Chat region being added to the dashboard by dragging. If it didn’t work, that would be this problem.</li></ul></li>

			<p class="calibre3">Even within a ChatGPT chat window, we can present tables, include images in results (such as product images, schematics, or diagrams), use incorrect terms, or even have scrolling issues.

			<p class="calibre3">So, we now have the top patch issue to address. Because the UNSs were so close (as discussed in <a href="B21964_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identifying Optimal Use Cases for ChatGPT</em>), it came down to which item was most straightforward to implement. The cost of doing an LLM solution to <em class="italic">Step 11</em> is estimated to be less because the model requires fewer moving parts to generate test cases. We need to know meta-information about the software, versions, platform, OS patching level, the list of existing patches, and we can use to tie in with existing bug information to create an LLM advisor. Developing models for <em class="italic">Step 12 </em>to monitor for abnormalities requires additional data sources and, thus, more API work to gather and provide the data. <em class="italic">Step 6</em> for predicting patch plan success is the most expensive to build and maintain because of the complexities of predicting how <em class="italic">trillions</em> of possible patch combinations might influence an installation.

There is a lot of overlap, but the inputs and outputs will vary. Knowing <a id="_idIndexMarker233" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>what patch collections are stable based on customer data from production instances is better understood than knowing what <em class="italic">should</em> work. The problem gets even more complex when we try to include an understanding of what could make it better or worse, which is why the estimate for <em class="italic">Step 6</em> is much larger. Your use cases will be easier to understand than our attempt to explain the patching processes for those unfamiliar with the area. There are also examples around the quality of the responses from an LLM as part of a conversation or coming from a recommendation; let me touch on that as well.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We know that the LLM will attempt to hallucinate and will try to respond. <a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Prompt Engineering</em>, will discuss how to control the output by creating guardrails and instructions for the LLM. When LLM generates wrong output this becomes an issue to score. The logs show which customers are impacted by the problem. Monitoring the output will help identify the frequency of the problem. Judge the severity of the issues against the rubric.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There is no one answer for scoring these; it will depend. Hallucinations can be harmful or not so bad. They happen constantly or rarely and could impact all customers or only a select audience. Likewise, this might be a lack of or conflicting knowledge, a missing API, a source not considered by the LLM, poor training, unclear prompts, or just out of the application’s scope. With log analysis, reviewed in <a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em> , plus scoring and prioritizing effort, the team has what it needs to tackle important work first.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor094" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Extending tracking tools with scoring</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Most Agile, product, or bug tracking tools can expose additional fields or columns. For example, a development priority drop menu (1 to 4 is typical) might already exist. UNS fields are similar but couched more in user-centric attributes.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Expose all four <a id="_idIndexMarker234" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>fields (the three individual and the final score that should be sortable) in the company’s tracking tool. This allows for visibility and discussions to validate assumptions. As mentioned, there might be slight disagreements, and exposing scores brings it into the open. Expect to be able to use this to drive the sort order for stories and bugs so that the sprint teams, release management, and customers can see how and why this order exists. Transparency is best here. Score and then sort by scores in the tracking tool. Jira is very popular and supports custom fields and even calculations. WSJF is supported in Rally, and most tools can handle these scores via customization.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Of course, sometimes too <a id="_idIndexMarker236" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>much is not a good thing. Resist the need to enhance scoring with more measures and capabilities. Start small. Let me explain why.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor096" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Creating more complex scoring methods</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">We are reminded of the <strong class="bold">KISS (Keep it simple, silly) principle</strong>. An organization can <em class="italic">go all the way</em> and create a score so complex <a id="_idIndexMarker237" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>that no one would understand the difference between something with a score of 2,032 and 2,840. I know a system with 17 factors adding and subtracting based on who escalated the issue (a VP escalating the issue is<a id="_idIndexMarker238" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> worth more than if I do it), how old the problem is when it was filed, and its severity, among many other factors. Everyone wants to get their factor into a score. Resist that approach.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I find that (and some simple research could confirm) a mortal would have no chance of getting a good feel for working with the output of a score based on 17 factors. Indeed, the proposed simple score method will not differentiate 20 stories, all with a score of 12. However, we suspect there will be more spread when accounting for the cost and work allocated across a few Agile teams. It is OK for items to wait their turn in an Agile backlog. Consider if including rules for ranking tied items would help. For example, a 12 for an issue for all customers should be prioritized higher than a 12 coming from a worse bug for fewer customers. However, the more complexity, the more difficult it is to understand and judge differences. Determine if it is worth the additional complexity, confusion, and overhead. Minimally, we advocate not ranking stories and scoring arbitrarily. Use a method that is repeatable and even can be consistently applied from team to team. So, aggregating rankings on a backlog is an apples-to-apples comparison. Once stories are divided by the costs, the values will spread out. Also, our goal is not spread. If two stories are judged the same, doing either story is just as valuable.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Working top-down from WSJF is not a religion. We don’t necessarily follow the WSJF as a dogma. It is a guide. Besides being a guide, different teams sometimes have specific expertise (not all organizations can be perfect about an Agile team doing it all). So, this can influence what teams pick from the backlog. Selecting the third item and leaving the first two for another team might be the most efficient and intelligent approach.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor097" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Working with multiple backlogs in Agile</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Usually, we have more than one backlog in a large enterprise development environment. So, this discussion is for those familiar with the complexities of multiple sprint team planning. The<a id="_idIndexMarker239" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> scrum team for the sprint has a backlog, and so does the project, maybe the program, and even the release. But effectively, these are virtual, and tagging an item for a sprint doesn’t mean ignoring the context of all other backlog items. A single large backlog is sometimes helpful to get a few key metrics out of it if done right. In Agile at scale, they look at different roll-ups of stories. At the program level, features that decompose into stories can be viewed. If the feature has a score of 36, it won’t mean that all stories in that feature will have the same value. As they are broken down, some stories are more important than others.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The program or product-level backlog might span 30 or more teams, as it did for my old organization. If a few teams represent 50% of the backlog (thinking now about story points or work effort, not in terms of the number of items), then maybe reconsider how teams are allocated. It is hard to compare if teams use different models to cost stories. However, we also want to balance team autonomy. In Scaled Agile, where many Agile teams are developing the same application, there is a need for a well-documented approach to story points. One more attempt to sell story points for those unconvinced.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Don’t be trapped by estimating in hours. There is value in abstract story points. However, being accurate with hours is a headache, and because different people work at different paces, there are complications. Mike Cohn writes about this.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Don’t Equate Story Points to Hours</a> (<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If there is one backlog and a consistent story point method, the delivery based on <strong class="bold">customer points</strong> can be compared. One team has five stories, each with a score of 12, having (5x12) 60 customer points in that sprint. Meanwhile, another team might do just three stories with scores of 36, 24, and 12, thus delivering roughly the same value (62 points) to the customer. A team tackling 15 stories with a sum of 30 provides 1/2 the value. A reallocation of teams to projects that have more customer points is warranted. This is not a challenge for a single sprint team working one list top down, but <a id="_idIndexMarker240" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>when doing Agile at scale, one has to consider when to reallocate sprint resources to be the most effective.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">For example, a typical org might count and report on bugs per software unit. A team with 50 editing and typographical bugs might not be best compared to a team with three performance bugs, and how quickly they fixed those bugs or if it was worth the time and energy. The team with three bugs might have been doing something far more valuable and costly (development cost) than the team with 50 easy bugs to fix. For design, we look at customer points. For development, in Agile, we can look at story points or the level of effort. Then, we can look at this single virtual backlog based on scores and learn something valuable.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">An <strong class="bold">ordered backlog</strong> is less helpful than <a id="_idIndexMarker242" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>one with scoring. Ranking on an ordinal scale (1 is higher than 2) is less potent <a id="_idIndexMarker243" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>than scoring (a 15 is 50% more than a 10). We learned this in introductory statistics. An <strong class="bold">interval scale</strong> (where the<a id="_idIndexMarker244" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> difference between two numbers is an equal interval) is more powerful and carries more information. A user score of 10 is twice a 5. Ranking something 5th and 10th does not communicate this importance. The 10th item is, at best, five behind item 5. That is, items 6 to 9 might not have huge differences in value. An interval (or ratio) scale reveals this.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A <strong class="bold">score</strong> is an interval <a id="_idIndexMarker245" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>scale, while a <strong class="bold">ranking</strong> is not. Scores are more powerful. A ratio scale is similar to an interval scale but has an absolute zero. The difference between them is not essential to this discussion. Just realize the value in knowing that the difference between 2 scores (6 to 12 and 12 to 18) represents the same difference.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This is why they show the points used to rank college football teams. Football fans then know how far <em class="italic">behind</em> their favorite team is from the next spot up.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Returning to <em class="italic">Table 4.2</em>, we can see that the first item on the original list, which scored 36, drops way down in priority because of its significant development cost. Look carefully and see the cost of delivering the first five items on the list; fixing all of them is better than fixing the single back button item, ranked first by UNS. This value is only revealed when accounting for development costs and rank by WSJF.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It would seem counterintuitive to not do something so valuable that it scores a 36 even with a long development lead time, which would be strategic and thus prioritized. However, those smaller items give more value. We optimize customer value.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are scoring issues. Realize this can be challenging. Being aware of possible hiccups means they can be addressed along the way.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor098" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Real-world hiccups with scoring</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">No scoring method is perfectly repeatable when people’s opinions come into play. We do our best to try to make a<a id="_idIndexMarker246" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> system that avoids debate. I have used this system for many years, and there are gotcha’s. Scott McNealy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, is often attributed with this variation of a Teddy Roosevelt quote, “The best decision is the right decision, the next best decision is the wrong decision, and the worst decision is no decision.” So, let’s put a stake in the ground, make the decisions to prioritize our backlog, know some limitations, and move forward.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor099" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>I know Agile, and this is not WSJF</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">I defer to the SAFe website or Donald Reinertsen’s <em class="italic">Principles of Product Development Flow</em> book. User Needs Scoring is a variation on the WSJF solution because it can be coached in an hour and repeated easily. The UNS is a proxy for the numerator (it is a<a id="_idIndexMarker247" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> combination of the values for user + business value, time criticality, and risk reduction + a score for opportunity enablement value). The actual WSJF uses a Fibonacci-type number, and using that scale has more breadth. Again, this is to help <em class="italic">keep it </em><em class="italic">simple, silly</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Is WSJF deployed in your organization? If so, excellent work. Is the CoD metric reliable and repeatable? If not, adopt a consistent rubric like the one proposed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor100" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The use of simple numbers one to four</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Notice that the SAFe supports the <a id="_idIndexMarker248" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>concept of an interval scale for scoring. The Fibonacci sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) conveys an interval scale. Interval scales are commonly used for costing development. Our straightforward scores are also on an interval scale but don’t have the spread of the Fibonacci sequence, as they only go from one to four. We can explore why the three—or four-point scales make sense.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Dean Leffingwell, the lead author of SAFe, suggests that because the larger numbers are less precise, using “<em class="italic">Fibonacci makes </em><em class="italic">consensus easier</em>.”</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220919164755/https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/prioritize-your-backlog-use-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf-improved-roi?amp" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Backlogs with WSJF</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220919164755/https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/prioritize-your-backlog-use-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf-improved-roi?amp" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://web.archive.org/web/20220919164755/https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/prioritize-your-backlog-use-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf-improved-roi?amp</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A consensus can be reached quickly with a small collection of numbers, but it is easy to appreciate that larger numbers are rough estimates and, thus, might not be worth debating. Simplicity makes the process easier to digest. If you have strong feelings about using Fibonacci and have good experiences with it for story estimates, <em class="italic">continue using it for cost</em>. It is an excellent tool for cost estimating. For User Needs Scoring, the spread in our numerator between small and unbounded large numbers won’t work. It would overwhelm stories. Scoring from 1 to 10 was evaluated, but the time debating a four versus a six doesn’t seem worth it. Having a ten-point rubric is very difficult. Stick with three or four values on the requirements side (the numerator). Development decides the denominator based on story points or the poker estimation we discussed earlier. Another consideration is to weigh each factor in the user score.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor101" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Weighting factors</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">It is always a good idea to consider whether values should be weighted more. We could introduce weighting without changing<a id="_idIndexMarker249" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the rubric or scale (one to three or four). Let’s take the Severity scores. We considered doing scores to align with a 100-point scale but didn’t find a good balance. 4 points are worth more than 3, but do we need it to be 100, 50, 25, or 10? Does multiplying or maybe not using a 1 for the last value make a difference? Someone should take that up as a research project. What would it look like to weigh each factor? It makes the calculation more complex.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We put the stake in the ground with our numbers. By multiplying the values together, each score is worth 33%. Weighting can be introduced if one score is worth more. I don’t know which one that would be. They all seem equally important. In any case, try it as documented, or do better, but don’t do less. The numbers allow for easy math.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><img src="img/4.png" alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;M&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.33&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;f&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.33&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.33&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;D&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" class="calibre22"/></p>
			<p class="calibre3">What is essential becomes more apparent after a few cycles. It is common to find that scores of 12 or greater are prioritized. Items that score lower sometimes are low-hanging fruit—that is, they are cheap to fix, so they don’t take up much time or energy but typically won’t drive excitement. They do drive consistency and quality. Severity deserves additional insight.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor102" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Severity seems complicated to judge</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Every development <a id="_idIndexMarker250" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>organization has some form of Bug severity. Typically, technology companies have four levels of bugs, but some companies go to five or six. Here is a GitHub document that provides an extensive collection of examples of severity. With practice, it becomes easier to judge.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">What we have seen is that Sev 2s get all the effort. Sev 1s are worked immediately, while Sev 4s, which generally revolve around fit and finish, never get worked. A collection of Sev 4s on the same feature adds up. Would anyone continue to use generative AI with poor grammar, typos, and a confusing layout? Each issue might seem insignificant, but having multiple problems in one element will quickly erode trust. Generally, we see very few of these errors in LLM outputs; it will be more about hallucinations, understanding questions that lack enough context, and lack of the correct enterprise knowledge, which will be a problem. These should be scored in the 1 to 3 range. Practice as a team so the collective expertise improves as the team judges’ severity. Don’t be scared by those big problems; Agile can help break them down into manageable parts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor103" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The cost is so high that we can’t ever get the work done</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">There is a solution in Agile for this. If the cost is high, consider how to break down the story into smaller parts. We don’t want jobs blocked, so we work with agile methods to get the right-sized stories. Delivering a piece of a story can still provide value. Sometimes, backend work is required that won’t return user value directly. Judge these stories by what user value they will enable down the road. Judge individual parts independently of the larger story or epic. It is sometimes a creative endeavor to figure out how a large story can be broken up. We can’t give a magic solution. Brainstorm, consider where user value is derived from, and look for partial solutions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor104" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Grouping issues into bugs to protect the quality</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The grouping of similar bugs <a id="_idIndexMarker251" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>makes sense. We don’t need a dozen bugs for the same fundamental change.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We are switching gears here. This is about the Severity of the issue as documented by the enterprise bug system. Recall that scores invert these values. Grouping issues allows the team to manage less work in the bug or tracking system. Save time tracking 100s of bugs when tracking 30 would make more sense.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">One suggestion is to look at the collection of issues and consider whether they are all related to the same problem. That is, can one fix and resolve three different bugs? Another issue is scope. If a collection of bugs is associated with the same material or within <a id="_idIndexMarker252" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a single ChatGPT instance (when doing RAG), use rules to aggregate bugs:</p>

				<li class="calibre8">A collection of 3 or more Severity 2 bugs for a specific problem, interaction, results, or element is equivalent to a Severity 1 bug (the “three strikes” rule)</li>
				<li class="calibre8">A collection of training synonyms or fine-tuning examples for one concept can be grouped into a single Severity 2 bug</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Five or more Severity 3 issues should be tracked as one Severity 2 item</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout"> A missing intent or task in conversational AI can be a Severity 2 “bug” (a bug because the original design/specification defined it) or a Severity 3 ER (if it was not realistic to have anticipated it).</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Finally, consider adding a gate to protect the quality of the release. We cannot know the scale of your problem, so adjust as needed:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">No Severity 1s for any instance or model</li>
				<li class="calibre8">No more than 2 Severity 2s open issues per instance or model</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">A bug and feature tracking system is required. Work WSJF into that software tool.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor105" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>How to work WSJF into the organization</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">These are simple<a id="_idIndexMarker253" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> calculations. Any spreadsheet can keep track of the results and be used to sort and order a list. However, building this into tracking tools such as Jira, Rally, or any homegrown tool is better. Include custom fields and drop-down menus for the scores, and then use a calculation field to divide the UNS by the development cost. Typically done in story points (recommended), but some organizations use days; any consistent method is acceptable compared to being random. Sort by this each time the backlog is reviewed to select work. This approach ensures the biggest bang for the buck.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor106" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Everything up to this point is to understand use cases and where to apply resources to evaluate and decide what to do with a ChatGPT solution. This chapter is an agile method that applies to ChatGPT interactions, recommender experiences, backend solutions, or any software development project. We needed a method to bridge the gap between defining use cases and deciding what use cases to tackle. Creating a repeatable method applies to any development project.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Do a few things with the learnings in this chapter:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Estimate the value of existing stories, use cases, bugs, or features</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Work with development to explain the story and get their cost estimate</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Work out issues in scoring stories and prioritize the backlog</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Integrate WSJF into the product life cycle</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Once a solution is up and running, we can apply more sophisticated approaches to evaluate LLM performance, but the same scoring concepts can be used there. We are almost done with our pre-development journey – one more stop. The next chapter will focus on designing the right experience. After that, once we go technical into ChatGPT technology, we can reevaluate and verify what was built and how it should improve, again drawing on the research and scorings discussion.</p>
