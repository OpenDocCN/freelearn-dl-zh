			</ul>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at how you can use Amazon Q Developer to suggest code in VS Code and PyCharm IDEs. We used the two most prominent programming languages used by developers, Python and Java, to demonstrate how auto-code can be generated using prompt techniques and leveraging a <span class="No-Break">chat-with-code-assistant technique.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will first explore some of the categories of programming languages. We will then discuss an overview of foundational programming languages before focusing on two dominant ones used in the software industry: C and C++. We will introduce how auto-code generation, especially in Amazon Q Developer, is integrated and can be used by C and C++ developers to understand, learn the syntax of, and automatically generate code. As a side benefit, by standardizing code across different programming languages, these tools can enhance code readability, maintainability, and interoperability across <span class="No-Break">large-scale projects.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Overview of programming language categories and foundational languages</h1>
			<p>The landscape of <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>software development has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few decades. As the demand for robust, efficient, and scalable applications has grown, the complexity of the coding process has increased. Consequently, various categories of coding languages have emerged to meet these <span class="No-Break">diverse needs.</span></p>
			<p>Foundational languages, such as C and C++, provide the essential constructs for many systems. Web <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>development languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, power dynamic and interactive web experiences. Database management languages, such as SQL, are crucial for handling large datasets. System administration and automation languages, such as Python and Bash, streamline repetitive tasks and enhance operational efficiency. <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) languages, such as Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, allow<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> developers to manage and provision computing infrastructure <span class="No-Break">through code.</span></p>
			<p>Each category addresses specific challenges, reflecting the multifaceted nature of modern technology ecosystems. Understanding these categories helps developers choose the right tools for their projects, leading to more <span class="No-Break">effective solutions.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Foundational languages C and C++, and auto-code generation support</h1>
			<p>C and C++ are<a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> foundational programming languages that have shaped the landscape of software development. Known for their performance and control over <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>system resources, these languages are crucial in various domains, including system programming, game development, and real-time<a id="_idIndexMarker253"/> processing applications. However, the very strengths that make C and C++ powerful also contribute to their complexity. Manual memory management, low-level operations, and intricate syntax can make coding in these languages error-prone <span class="No-Break">and time-consuming.</span></p>
			<p>To mitigate these challenges and enhance productivity, auto-code generation has emerged as a transformative solution. Auto-code generation involves using advanced tools to automatically produce source code based on predefined templates or specifications. This automation can significantly reduce the manual effort required in coding, minimize errors, and standardize code quality. Among the leading tools in this domain is Amazon Q Developer, which brings powerful capabilities to the table for C and C++ code generation. As discussed in previous chapters, Amazon Q Developer is an innovative tool <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to assist developers in writing code. By integrating Amazon Q Developer into the development workflow, programmers can benefit from its sophisticated code generation features tailored specifically for C <span class="No-Break">and C++.</span></p>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>primary advantages of using Amazon Q Developer for C and C++ code generation is the significant reduction in development time. Writing boilerplate code, such as memory management routines, data structures, and error handling, can be tedious and repetitive. Amazon Q Developer can provide recommendations to automate these tasks, allowing developers to focus on learning and implementing the more complex and creative aspects of their projects. This not only accelerates the development process but also enhances the overall code quality by ensuring that repetitive tasks are handled consistently <span class="No-Break">and correctly.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, Amazon Q aids <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>in bridging the knowledge gap for developers who are new to C and C++. The learning curve for these languages can be steep, given their complexity and need for meticulous attention to detail. By providing auto-generated code examples and templates, Amazon Q serves as an educational tool, helping developers understand and adopt the proper syntax and coding conventions more quickly. This feature is particularly beneficial in educational settings and for onboarding new team members, as it provides concrete examples of how theoretical concepts are applied <span class="No-Break">in practice.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, Amazon Q Developer is equipped with advanced debugging and optimization capabilities. It can identify potential issues in the code and suggest optimizations, ensuring that the generated code is not only correct but also efficient. This feature is crucial in performance-critical applications where even minor inefficiencies can have <span class="No-Break">significant impacts.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help a programmer. To illustrate this, I will be using the Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> for the configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code and the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter for C/C++ for <span class="No-Break">VS Code).</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs, which, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers or code blocks shown in the code snapshots. Try to update your prompts to get the desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer or code should meet <span class="No-Break">the requirements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>C auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, assume a<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> new programmer is planning to work with C and does not have a background in this language. Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate <span class="No-Break">the programmer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>C language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s learn<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> about C <span class="No-Break">programming language:</span></p>

			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker259"/> can see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided historical information about the original developers of the C language. It then summarized the common use cases by categorizing where the C language excels. Additionally, it offered sources for further reference <span class="No-Break">and learning.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s ask for commands that are commonly used by <span class="No-Break">C programmers:</span></p>

			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>not be going through each command in detail, but for illustration, as shown in the preceding partial screenshots, Amazon Q Developer provided several examples of common commands and constructs in the C programming language. To make it easy to follow, it categorized them into groups such as conditional constructs, looping constructs, functions, and more. Additionally, you can see that it provided references at the end for users to obtain further detailed information on <span class="No-Break">the topics.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s ask Amazon Q Developer for the syntax and an example of a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>End-to-end C language use case development</h2>
			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>let’s move to the sample use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend code. To illustrate this, I am going to use the VS Code script editor window with single and <span class="No-Break">multi-line prompts.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s say that we want to write a C program to read a list of integers from a file, sort them, and write the sorted list to another file. This is a very common use case to see multiple functionalities of <span class="No-Break">C language.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s use the multi-line prompt technique to achieve the preceding <span class="No-Break">use case.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* Write the end-to-end C language program to read a list of integers from a file "input.txt" then sorts that list and then writes the sorted list to output file "output.txt"

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – A C program sample snapshot</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot shows a partial code suggested by Amazon Q Developer. The end-to-end generated C code by Amazon Q Developer demonstrates several fundamental and advanced concepts in C programming, including functions, arrays, pointers, and file I/O operations. It also added error handling related to <strong class="source-inline">"Error </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">opening file"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> use an interactive inline prompt with the chain-of-thought technique to enhance the code. As you can see in the <strong class="source-inline">readIntegersFromFile()</strong> function, Amazon Q Developer already added <strong class="source-inline">"Error opening file"</strong>. Now, let’s instruct it to check for zero-byte files as well. Just go inside the function and use the single-line prompt technique <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* check if file is zero byte*/</pre>			<div>
