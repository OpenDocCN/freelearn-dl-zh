			<ul>
				<li>Overview of programming language categories and foundational languages</li>
				<li>C auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>C++ auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>C and C++ code explainability and optimization Using Amazon Q Developer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at how you can use Amazon Q Developer to suggest code in VS Code and PyCharm IDEs. We used the two most prominent programming languages used by developers, Python and Java, to demonstrate how auto-code can be generated using prompt techniques and leveraging a chat-with-code-assistant technique.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will first explore some of the categories of programming languages. We will then discuss an overview of foundational programming languages before focusing on two dominant ones used in the software industry: C and C++. We will introduce how auto-code generation, especially in Amazon Q Developer, is integrated and can be used by C and C++ developers to understand, learn the syntax of, and automatically generate code. As a side benefit, by standardizing code across different programming languages, these tools can enhance code readability, maintainability, and interoperability across large-scale projects.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Overview of programming language categories and foundational languages</h1>
			<p>The landscape of <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>software development has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few decades. As the demand for robust, efficient, and scalable applications has grown, the complexity of the coding process has increased. Consequently, various categories of coding languages have emerged to meet these diverse needs.</p>
			<p>Foundational languages, such as C and C++, provide the essential constructs for many systems. Web <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>development languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, power dynamic and interactive web experiences. Database management languages, such as SQL, are crucial for handling large datasets. System administration and automation languages, such as Python and Bash, streamline repetitive tasks and enhance operational efficiency. <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) languages, such as Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, allow<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> developers to manage and provision computing infrastructure through code.</p>
			<p>Each category addresses specific challenges, reflecting the multifaceted nature of modern technology ecosystems. Understanding these categories helps developers choose the right tools for their projects, leading to more effective solutions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Foundational languages C and C++, and auto-code generation support</h1>
			<p>C and C++ are<a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> foundational programming languages that have shaped the landscape of software development. Known for their performance and control over <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>system resources, these languages are crucial in various domains, including system programming, game development, and real-time<a id="_idIndexMarker253"/> processing applications. However, the very strengths that make C and C++ powerful also contribute to their complexity. Manual memory management, low-level operations, and intricate syntax can make coding in these languages error-prone and time-consuming.</p>
			<p>To mitigate these challenges and enhance productivity, auto-code generation has emerged as a transformative solution. Auto-code generation involves using advanced tools to automatically produce source code based on predefined templates or specifications. This automation can significantly reduce the manual effort required in coding, minimize errors, and standardize code quality. Among the leading tools in this domain is Amazon Q Developer, which brings powerful capabilities to the table for C and C++ code generation. As discussed in previous chapters, Amazon Q Developer is an innovative tool <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to assist developers in writing code. By integrating Amazon Q Developer into the development workflow, programmers can benefit from its sophisticated code generation features tailored specifically for C and C++.</p>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>primary advantages of using Amazon Q Developer for C and C++ code generation is the significant reduction in development time. Writing boilerplate code, such as memory management routines, data structures, and error handling, can be tedious and repetitive. Amazon Q Developer can provide recommendations to automate these tasks, allowing developers to focus on learning and implementing the more complex and creative aspects of their projects. This not only accelerates the development process but also enhances the overall code quality by ensuring that repetitive tasks are handled consistently and correctly.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, Amazon Q aids <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>in bridging the knowledge gap for developers who are new to C and C++. The learning curve for these languages can be steep, given their complexity and need for meticulous attention to detail. By providing auto-generated code examples and templates, Amazon Q serves as an educational tool, helping developers understand and adopt the proper syntax and coding conventions more quickly. This feature is particularly beneficial in educational settings and for onboarding new team members, as it provides concrete examples of how theoretical concepts are applied in practice.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Amazon Q Developer is equipped with advanced debugging and optimization capabilities. It can identify potential issues in the code and suggest optimizations, ensuring that the generated code is not only correct but also efficient. This feature is crucial in performance-critical applications where even minor inefficiencies can have significant impacts.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help a programmer. To illustrate this, I will be using the Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> for the configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code and the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter for C/C++ for VS Code).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs, which, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers or code blocks shown in the code snapshots. Try to update your prompts to get the desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer or code should meet the requirements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>C auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, assume a<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> new programmer is planning to work with C and does not have a background in this language. Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate the programmer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>C language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s learn<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> about C programming language:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Learning about the C language in chat style</p>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker259"/> can see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided historical information about the original developers of the C language. It then summarized the common use cases by categorizing where the C language excels. Additionally, it offered sources for further reference and learning.</p>
			<p>Now let’s ask for commands that are commonly used by C programmers:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What are the common commands in programming language C ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.2 – Learning about common C programmer commands" src="img/B21378_05_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Learning about common C programmer commands</p>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>not be going through each command in detail, but for illustration, as shown in the preceding partial screenshots, Amazon Q Developer provided several examples of common commands and constructs in the C programming language. To make it easy to follow, it categorized them into groups such as conditional constructs, looping constructs, functions, and more. Additionally, you can see that it provided references at the end for users to obtain further detailed information on the topics.</p>
			<p>Now let’s ask Amazon Q Developer for the syntax and an example of a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Provide syntax and example of "for loop" in C</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.3 – Learning about the for loop" src="img/B21378_05_3.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – Learning about the for loop</p>
			<p>Observe, in <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>the preceding and following screenshots, that Amazon Q Developer provided the syntax, details, and an example of a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.4 – A for loop example" src="img/B21378_05_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – A for loop example</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>End-to-end C language use case development</h2>
			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>let’s move to the sample use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend code. To illustrate this, I am going to use the VS Code script editor window with single and multi-line prompts.</p>
			<p>Let’s say that we want to write a C program to read a list of integers from a file, sort them, and write the sorted list to another file. This is a very common use case to see multiple functionalities of C language.</p>
			<p>Let’s use the multi-line prompt technique to achieve the preceding use case.</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* Write the end-to-end C language program to read a list of integers from a file "input.txt" then sorts that list and then writes the sorted list to output file "output.txt"
*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.5 – A C program sample snapshot" src="img/B21378_05_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – A C program sample snapshot</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot shows a partial code suggested by Amazon Q Developer. The end-to-end generated C code by Amazon Q Developer demonstrates several fundamental and advanced concepts in C programming, including functions, arrays, pointers, and file I/O operations. It also added error handling related to <code>"Error </code><code>opening file"</code>.</p>
			<p>Now let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> use an interactive inline prompt with the chain-of-thought technique to enhance the code. As you can see in the <code>readIntegersFromFile()</code> function, Amazon Q Developer already added <code>"Error opening file"</code>. Now, let’s instruct it to check for zero-byte files as well. Just go inside the function and use the single-line prompt technique as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* check if file is zero byte*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.6 – A C program inline function enhancement" src="img/B21378_05_6.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – A C program inline function enhancement</p>
			<p>As shown in the screenshot, based on our prompt, Amazon Q Developer added an <code>if</code> condition to check whether the input file is zero bytes. If the file is empty, the code gracefully exits with a <code>File is empty</code> message and a non-zero exit code.</p>
			<p>In the next section, let’s explore the functionality of Amazon Q Developer with C++.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>C++ auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Similar to<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> the preceding section, let’s first assume that a new programmer is planning to work with C++ and does not have a background in this language. We will use similar chat-style interface prompts from the C language section to learn the basics of the C++ language with the help of Amazon Q Developer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>C++ language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>learn about C++ programming language:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Learning about C++ programming</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided historical information about the original developers. It then summarized the common use cases by<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> categorizing where the C++ language excels. Additionally, it offered sources for further reference and learning.</p>
			<p>Now let’s ask for commands that are commonly used by C++ programmers:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What are the common commands in programming language C++?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.8 – Learning about common programmer C++ commands" src="img/B21378_05_8.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – Learning about common programmer C++ commands</p>
			<p>We will not be going through each command but just for illustration, as you can see in the following partial screenshots, Amazon Q Developer provided several categories of the common commands and constructs in the C++ programming language. To make it easy to follow, it also included some of the common key commands for each sample command. Additionally, you can see that it provided references at the end for users to obtain further detailed information on the topics.</p>
			<p>Based on the information provided you can observe that C++ shines in the area of <strong class="bold">Object-Oriented Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>), so <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to provide details and examples related to C++ support for OOP:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is Object-Oriented Programming and how C++ supports it ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.9 – Learning about C++ OOP" src="img/B21378_05_9.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9 – Learning about C++ OOP</p>
			<p>As seen in the <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>preceding screenshot, Amazon Q provided an overview of OOP basics and key concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. It also included corresponding C++ constructs such as <code>class</code>,<code> public</code>,<code> private</code>, and <code>protected</code>.</p>
			<p>Now let’s ask <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>Amazon Q Developer for the syntax and example of the <code>do... </code><code>while</code> loop:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>End-to-end C++ language use case development</h2>
			<p>Now let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>move to the sample use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend code. To illustrate, I am going to use the VS Code script editor window with single and multi-line prompts.</p>
			<p>Let’s say that we want to write a C++ program to develop a new operating system kernel, which can control system resources and has the ability to handle complex memory management tasks. The kernel must interact with hardware, manage processes, and ensure stability across different hardware architectures.</p>
			<p>Let’s use the multi-line prompt technique to achieve the preceding use case.</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>preceding screenshot shows partial code suggested by Amazon Q Developer. You can observe that end-to-end code demonstrates several fundamental and advanced concepts in C++ programming, including OOP, classes, vectors, functions, error handling, and more.</p>
			<p>Now let’s use an interactive inline prompt with the chain-of-thought technique to enhance the code. As you can see, the <code>loadProcess()</code> function does not have exception handling, so let’s instruct it to add an exception handle for the null process with the single-line prompt technique:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt :
/* add exception handling for loadProcess */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.12 – Prompt – C++ program sample snapshot" src="img/B21378_05_13.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12 – Prompt – C++ program sample snapshot</p>
			<p>As shown in <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>the screenshot, based on our prompt, Amazon Q Developer added a <code>nullptr</code> condition to check the process load exception. If it encounters a null pointer, then the code gracefully exits with a <code>Error: process is </code><code>null</code> message.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>C and C++ code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>provides options for achieving code explainability and optimization and is applicable to both C and C++.
