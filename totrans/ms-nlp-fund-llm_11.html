<p class="calibre6">We had an opportunity to pick the brains of each of these experienced folks and learn about how their career intersects and leverage AI and LLMs. We tailored questions to each of them so to allow them to teach us through their insights and perspectives. We found these discussions to be rewarding as they shed light on topics that are common and would be valuable for anyone who reads this book. Let’s dive right in.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-254" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor560" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov</h2>
<p class="calibre6">Nitzan brings the CAIO’s perspective as he and Ebay are encountering the vast potential that AI and LLM’s have to offer. He shares many diversified aspects that the CAIO has to address and decide on.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Let’s go through the questions and answers with Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-255" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor561" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q1.1 – Future of LLM – hybrid learning paradigms: In light of the evolving landscape of learning schemes, what do you envision as the next breakthrough in combining different learning paradigms within LLMs?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">In thinking about the potential next breakthrough in combining different learning paradigms within LLMs, I can articulate these ideas:</p>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Transition to large foundation models (LFMs)</strong>: A clear next step in the evolution of learning paradigms is the move toward fully multimodal models or LFMs. These models integrate and process multiple forms of data (for example, text, images, audio) simultaneously, offering a more holistic understanding and generating more contextually rich responses. This transition is expected to precede any significant changes in the underlying architecture of current models.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Scalability and model-size optimization</strong>: One of the primary challenges with deploying LLMs is scalability. Future developments will likely focus on creating models that maintain high performance while being significantly smaller in size. This involves reducing the number of hyperparameters and optimizing the models to work efficiently with less computational resources.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Real-time model triage</strong>: The ability to select the best model for each specific prompt in real time is anticipated to be a significant area of improvement. This involves optimizing given constraints such as computation resources, response time, or performance. It allows for the dynamic selection of the most appropriate model based on the task at hand, rather than relying solely on the largest model available.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Mitigating hallucinations through multiple LLMs</strong>: The more generalizable a model, the higher the risk of generating hallucinations (inaccurate or fabricated<a id="_idIndexMarker1073" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> information). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is the use of multiple LLMs, where several LLMs are used simultaneously to check each other’s answers to validate responses. This not only improves the accuracy but also leverages the synergy between various models, each playing specialized roles.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Mimicking human ability for broad usefulness</strong>: For LLMs to be broadly useful, they need to mimic human intelligence more closely. This includes not only generating accurate information but also reasoning in a more contextually driven and nuanced manner, beyond binary true/false outputs. The evolution toward models that can understand and interpret complex, fuzzy logic similar to human thought processes is a critical area for future breakthroughs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6">These ideas point toward a future where AI models are not only more efficient and scalable but also significantly more intelligent and capable of nuanced understanding and reasoning. The emphasis on multimodality, scalability, real-time optimization, and enhanced reasoning capabilities highlights the direction of AI development toward more holistic, human-like intelligence and utility.</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">Q1.2 – In the context of using multiple LLMs simultaneously, How can we optimize the synergy among these “expert” models to achieve a more refined and comprehensive output?</h3>
<p class="calibre6">The use of multiple LLMs can go beyond the notion of validation and reducing hallucinations. A broader idea, sometimes referred to as K-LLMs, can utilize multiple LLMs to answer a question or create a complex solution. One such scheme, as discussed previously, could be where each of the models checks each other’s answers to validate responses. A possible other approach is where they are assigned roles where each has its particular specialty (for example, product manager, designer, frontend engineer, backend engineer, and QA engineer) and they iterate over the solution, forming a team of experts. This can also allow for smaller and specialized LLMs, which are thus cheaper to train, quicker to process, and smaller in computation requirements.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-256" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor562" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q2.1 – As the Chief AI Officer becomes more integral to the corporate hierarchy, what unique challenges do you foresee in bridging the gap between AI potential and practical business applications, and how should the CAIO’s role evolve to meet these challenges?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">As the Chief AI Officer, my role <a id="_idIndexMarker1074" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>encompasses navigating the expansive impact AI has across various domains within our organization. Here are some of the most significant areas of focus for me:</p>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Breadth of AI’s impact</strong>: The expansive reach of AI across various domains within a large business requires the CAIO to have a deep understanding of both back-office and front-office needs. This necessitates a wide-reaching engagement across the company to identify and prioritize opportunities for AI’s transformative impact.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Effort and prioritization</strong>: The role demands substantial effort in prioritization due to the impossibility of being involved in every aspect of a large enterprise. This involves making decisions with limited data on where the biggest return on investment lies, drawing on experiences from other companies, and understanding internal operations to gauge where AI can have significant impacts.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Pressure for quick impact</strong>: There’s a pronounced pressure to deliver tangible results swiftly, contending with existing technological, process, and personnel constraints. Integrating AI innovations into the current ecosystem without overhauling preexisting processes presents a substantial challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="calibre8">Q2.2 – As a continuation of the question around the CAIO’s role, could you tell me about the regulatory aspects and where the CAIO’s role meets them?</h3>
<p class="calibre6">On the regulation front, I spend a considerable amount of time in discussions with our legal team, compliance officers, and information security personnel. The landscape for AI regulation is largely uncharted, which means crafting guidelines and guardrails where precedents are scant. Ideally, I seek clear dos and don’ts, but often, it’s a collaborative effort to define these guidelines. This ongoing conversation focuses on managing risk, protecting our customers, and advancing innovation while minimizing our risk exposure.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We’ve established an Office of Responsible AI, tasked with defining the appropriate business contexts for AI applications. Much of this work involves navigating ethical considerations beyond mere<a id="_idIndexMarker1075" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> legal compliance, especially since regulations tend to address high-risk areas. However, about 90% of typical company operations fall outside these high-risk categories, placing us in a regulatory gray area. Here, ethical judgment becomes paramount. While I am in favor of the emerging global regulations, I recognize they provide a framework rather than a complete solution. These regulations, focusing primarily on high-risk areas, still require nuanced application in our daily operations.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In essence, my role as CAIO demands a versatile approach that balances technical expertise, ethical foresight, and strategic planning. It’s about harnessing AI’s potential responsibly and effectively navigating both the broad applicability of AI across the business and the evolving landscape of AI ethics and regulations.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-257" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor563" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q3 – How do foundation models and the strategies of major tech companies toward open sourcing affect data ownership and its value for businesses?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">As Chief AI Officer, I find myself frequently contemplating the shifting significance of proprietary data ownership within our current AI-driven business paradigm. On one hand, foundation models are democratizing AI, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for companies that lack extensive proprietary datasets. These models offer performance that appears just as robust as if they were trained on specialized, proprietary data. This trend could suggest that the value of owning unique datasets may be diminishing, as powerful AI capabilities become accessible to a wider range of entities without substantial data assets.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, the landscape is nuanced. We’re witnessing a rise in techniques such as fine-tuning and additional pre-training, which tailor these generalist models to specific needs, subtly reinstating the importance of unique data. This customization capability hints that data ownership might evolve rather than diminish in relevance, serving as a new competitive edge or barrier to entry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Furthermore, the strategic pivots of major companies such as Meta toward open sourcing their AI solutions are not purely altruistic but are aimed at disrupting the status quo, challenging the dominance of giants such as Microsoft and Google. This move toward open sourcing is reshaping the industry, compelling these giants to augment their offerings with more comprehensive, enterprise-oriented ecosystems around their models. The ultimate value proposition is no longer just the models themselves but the entire package—the ecosystems <a id="_idIndexMarker1076" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>that support them, making them appealing for enterprise applications.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Amidst this, the role of regulators and differing international stances on data privacy and sharing come into play, potentially steering the market in various directions. This creates a complex environment where businesses must navigate not only technological advancements but also regulatory landscapes that could influence the strategic value of data ownership.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In conclusion, while the democratization of AI through foundation models and open source initiatives challenges traditional notions of data ownership, it simultaneously opens new avenues for competitive differentiation. Businesses must stay agile, reevaluating their data strategies in light of these developments, to leverage AI effectively while navigating the regulatory and strategic nuances of this evolving landscape.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-258" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor564" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>David Sontag</h2>
<p class="calibre6">David has a long track record of academic research which he dovetails with industry engagements and collaborations. In this section, he shares his novel insights on some of the emerging developments in LLMs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Let’s go through the questions and answers with David Sontag.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-259" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor565" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q1 – As we progress toward creating more equitable and unbiased datasets, what strategies do you believe are most effective in identifying and mitigating implicit biases within large datasets?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">In the realm of healthcare, the<a id="_idIndexMarker1077" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> application of ML extends beyond mere predictive analytics to fostering insights that can fundamentally alter patient care and outcomes. This domain’s complexity is underscored by the challenge of capturing the nuanced social determinants of health—variables such as living conditions, food security, and access to transportation—that significantly influence health outcomes. However, the current landscape of data collection and model training often overlooks these critical, yet less quantifiable aspects of patient life, leading to a gap in the personalized application of ML predictions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A predominant issue arises from the reliance on surrogates or proxies in datasets that fail to encapsulate the individual’s complexity fully. This reliance can obscure the subtleties inherent to each patient, thereby diluting the potential for ML to effect meaningful change in healthcare settings. The disparity between what the data models are trained on and the real-world contexts they are applied to further complicates this issue. For instance, LLMs trained on generic text data lack the contextual richness necessary for nuanced applications, such as tailoring healthcare recommendations to individual social circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This disconnect not only hampers the model’s utility in providing relevant insights but also introduces unintended biases. These biases emerge when models, devoid of context or unaware of their training data’s limitations, misapply generalized predictions to individual cases. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted effort toward enriching data collection processes to capture a more comprehensive view of patient social determinants and ensuring models can interpret and apply this information effectively.</p>
<p class="calibre6">To mitigate implicit biases in large datasets and advance toward equitable ML models, a multifaceted approach focusing on data collection, analysis, and model refinement is essential. Key strategies include decomposing discrimination metrics into bias, variance, and noise (“<em class="italic">Why is my classifier discriminatory?</em>”) to identify specific sources of unfairness, emphasizing the critical<a id="_idIndexMarker1078" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> role of contextually rich and adequately sized training samples to improve both fairness and accuracy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Additionally, augmenting datasets with more representative samples and relevant variables can address disparities in predictive performance across different groups (“<em class="italic">The Potential For Bias In Machine Learning And Opportunities For Health Insurers To Address It</em>”). Implementing these strategies necessitates a rigorous, ongoing evaluation of model outputs and impacts, ensuring they do not perpetuate existing biases or introduce new ones. Collaborative industry efforts toward algorithmic vigilance, ethical use of sensitive data, and incorporating diverse perspectives in model development processes are also vital. By prioritizing fairness as a fundamental aspect of model accuracy and utility, we can leverage ML to deliver more just and equitable outcomes across sectors.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In summary, before delving into strategies for creating equitable and unbiased datasets as outlined previously, it’s crucial to acknowledge the foundational challenges faced by ML in healthcare. These challenges include the need for a deeper understanding of patient social determinants and the imperative to bridge the gap between what the data models are trained on and the contexts in which they are deployed. Addressing these issues is a prerequisite for leveraging ML to its fullest potential in improving healthcare outcomes and ensuring that innovations in ML contribute positively and equitably to patient care.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-260" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor566" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q2 – How do you see these strategies evolving with the advancement of NLP technologies, and what do you envision as the next breakthrough in combining different learning paradigms within LLMs?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">As NLP technologies continue to evolve, strategies to enhance their utility and fairness are also advancing, particularly in the work led by David Sontag’s team at MIT. David shared these three research advancements that they are leading in the lab:</p>
<ol class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: A cornerstone of their research is the development of methodologies to provide comprehensive attribution for each piece of information output by NLP models. This involves tracing back to the training data to identify the sources that influenced the model’s predictions. Such an approach not only bolsters the credibility and reliability of NLP applications but also empowers users to verify the origins of the information presented to them. By enabling a clear lineage <a id="_idIndexMarker1079" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>from the output back to the input, users can understand the rationale behind a model’s decision, enhancing trust in NLP systems.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Utilization of general-purpose LLMs for specific domains</strong>: The team is exploring innovative ways to adapt general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4 to specialized fields without the need for extensive retraining or fine-tuning. This is achieved through a method that allows these models to collaborate, leveraging their general capabilities alongside models with domain-specific knowledge—such as medicine—to provide more accurate and relevant outputs. This strategy signifies a shift toward more adaptable and efficient use of existing NLP resources, ensuring that advancements in the field can be readily applied to a variety of specialized contexts without incurring prohibitive costs or time delays. (<em class="italic">My personal comment</em>: This use case is a particular case of one of two use cases we have covered that revolve around utilizing multiple LLMs simultaneously. The first is the K-LLMs scheme where multiple models all interact with each other in a setting that is meant to mimic a committee of experts. Each model has its own role (for example, a software developer collaborating with a QA engineer, or a project manager collaborating with a designer), and they take turns in refining the resulting output. Here, each role can be played by the same model; for example, each role could be represented by OpenAI’s GPT, or different models can take on different roles, where the role that each model takes is chosen based on the strengths and weaknesses the model has. The second is a case where there are several different models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses (for example, one is fast but doesn’t generate quality insights; the other is slow but is very precise), and the “right” model is to be chosen on a per-input basis by a decision process that is optimized to suit given constraints. For instance, a prompt that requires a binary <em class="italic">Yes/No</em> inference on a given small set of sentences may be channeled to a simple LLM while a prompt that requires applying legal judgment may be directed to the latest GPT version.)</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Fine-tuning LLMs efficiently</strong>: Another focal point of their research addresses the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs in a way that is both data and computationally efficient. This involves identifying the most impactful hyperparameters within an LLM’s architecture to adjust, determining which should remain fixed and <a id="_idIndexMarker1080" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>which should be tuned to adapt the model to specific needs. The goal here is to maintain the integrity and strength of the original model while optimizing it for particular applications, thereby extending the utility of LLMs across diverse domains with minimal resource expenditure.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre6">These advancements underscore a broader commitment to improving the flexibility, transparency, and applicability of NLP technologies. By focusing on these key areas, David Sontag’s research at MIT aims to propel the field forward, ensuring NLP tools are not only more powerful but also more accessible, understandable, and ethical for users across various sectors. This approach aligns with the highest standards of academic and practical excellence, promising to shape the next generation of NLP applications in healthcare and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-261" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor567" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q3 – We are witnessing an ongoing evolution of regulations around AI from the aspects of training data and model usage. What are the implications for the future development of LLMs in this regulated landscape?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">In the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding AI, significant implications are emerging for the future development of LLMs. As regulations continue to advance, focusing on AI safety, including concerns around national security threats and the ethical use of AI, the framework within which LLMs are developed and deployed is being reshaped:</p>
<ol class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Evolving regulations</strong>: The regulation of AI is set to intensify, emphasizing the importance of safety and appropriateness in the application of AI technologies. This evolving regulatory environment necessitates a proactive approach to compliance, where developers of LLMs must ensure their models are not just effective but also align with emerging legal and ethical standards. These regulations aim to mitigate risks associated with AI, guiding the industry toward responsible innovation.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Quality of data and models</strong>: Both the industry and academia are actively engaged in enhancing the quality of data used to train models. This pursuit of quality is foundational to the development of more accurate and reliable LLMs, as models benefit from learning from well-curated and representative data. Research indicates the <a id="_idIndexMarker1081" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>potential for efficiency in data usage, where selecting the “right” data could drastically reduce the need for large datasets without compromising the model’s performance. This efficiency not only aligns with regulatory demands for transparency and accountability but also opens avenues for more sustainable model development processes.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Metadata and model monitoring</strong>: The incorporation of metadata into the training process represents a pivotal shift toward greater accountability and interpretability in LLMs. By attaching detailed metadata to data points used in model training, developers can offer a clear audit trail that elucidates how models arrive at their conclusions. This capability is crucial for monitoring model performance and ensuring that LLMs operate within ethical and legal boundaries. It also reflects a broader industry trend toward embracing ML interpretability methods, which enable stakeholders to scrutinize and understand the decision-making processes of LLMs.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre6">These developments, forecasted by David Sontag’s insights, underscore a future where LLMs are not only technologically advanced but also ethically grounded and regulatory compliant. This trajectory ensures that as LLMs become more embedded in various sectors, they do so in a manner that prioritizes safety, fairness, and transparency. Such an approach not only aligns with the highest standards of academic excellence but also positions LLMs to make a positive and responsible impact on society.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-262" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor568" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>John D. Halamka</h2>
<p class="calibre6">John brings the executive aspect to this chapter. In this section dedicated to his perspectives, he lays a broad spectrum of insights and actions that companies and organizations can roll out so to enable AI advancements in a very monitored and responsible orientation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Let’s go through the questions and answers with John D. Halamka.</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">Q1.1 – How does Mayo Clinic strategize a policy for reconciling open, reproducible research with stringent privacy protections within the NLP community, and how does it navigate the complex landscape of international regulations?</h3>
<p class="calibre6">In reconciling the need for open, reproducible research with the protection of individual privacy within the NLP community, the “Data Behind Glass” model pioneered by the <strong class="bold">Mayo Clinic Platform</strong> offers a compelling solution. This model represents a paradigm shift in the handling of sensitive health data, embodying a platform-centric approach that ensures data quality, regulatory compliance, and, above all, the maintenance of patient trust throughout the data’s life cycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At its core, Mayo Clinic Platform Connect serves as a distributed data network that exemplifies a federated architecture. Within this network, partners contribute their unique datasets while retaining strict control over their data, safeguarding privacy and confidentiality within their organizational IT boundaries. This federated approach enables a collaborative yet secure environment for data sharing and utilization.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Key to the success of this model is the meticulous process of data de-identification. By employing industry-accepted statistical methods aligned with privacy laws and regulations, data is rendered anonymous, ensuring that individual privacy is preserved while retaining the data’s value for research and development. Techniques such as hashing, uniform date-shifting, and tokenization are utilized to obfuscate data, facilitating its use in federated learning without compromising patient privacy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Moreover, the secure-by-design philosophy underpinning Connect ensures that data and <strong class="bold">intellectual property</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) remain under the control of their respective owners, accessible only as authorized. This approach<a id="_idIndexMarker1082" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> not only protects privacy but also fosters innovation by allowing Mayo Clinic Platform customers to develop, train, and validate algorithms on de-identified data cohorts. Rigorous controls, including code repository reviews, strict access management, and prohibitions on data imports and exports, further reinforce the platform’s commitment to privacy and security.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The “Data Behind Glass” model is uniquely positioned to address the evolving regulatory landscape. With international regulators intensifying scrutiny over AI and ML applications, Mayo Clinic Platform’s adaptable framework is designed to navigate the complex patchwork of global privacy <a id="_idIndexMarker1083" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>regulations. Whether it’s the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) in the European Union, the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Law</strong> (<strong class="bold">LGPD</strong>) in Brazil, or China’s security and privacy rules, the model ensures<a id="_idIndexMarker1084" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> compliance while enabling global collaboration.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In summary, the “Data Behind Glass” model presents a viable pathway for the NLP community to achieve the dual <a id="_idIndexMarker1085" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>objectives of fostering open research and safeguarding privacy. By de-identifying, securing, and federating data, Mayo Clinic Platform democratizes its use without compromising patient privacy, setting a precedent for responsible data handling in an era where the balance between transparency and privacy is paramount.

<h2 id="_idParaDest-263" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor569" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q2 – AI-driven organizational structure – in what ways do you predict AI will continue to reshape companies’ organizational structures to maximize the benefits of AI?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">“AI indeed reshapes companies. In particular, at Mayo Clinic we asked ourselves the question, should we centralize AI operations or distribute them within the organization? I have observed many cases where different approaches were applied. At Mayo, our approach has been to decentralize all AI work but centralize data governance and policymaking. That enables innovation without regret.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Let’s review some of the key benefits of this work model.</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">Decentralized AI work model benefits</h3>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Enhanced innovation and agility</strong>: By decentralizing AI operations, organizations such as the Mayo Clinic foster an <a id="_idIndexMarker1089" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>environment where individual departments can innovate and apply AI solutions tailored to their specific needs and challenges. This flexibility allows for quicker adaptation and implementation of AI technologies.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Empowerment and ownership</strong>: Decentralizing AI empowers individual teams and departments with the autonomy to explore AI applications and solutions. This sense of ownership can drive more engaged and motivated teams, leading to innovative solutions and improvements in their operations.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Diverse applications and solutions</strong>: A decentralized approach enables a broader exploration of AI across different facets of an organization. Different departments can experiment with AI to solve diverse problems, leading to a wide array of AI-driven solutions and applications tailored to various organizational needs.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Rapid experimentation and learning</strong>: With AI decentralized, teams can quickly test, learn, and iterate on AI projects without the bottleneck of centralized decision-making. This rapid experimentation can lead to faster discoveries and more<a id="_idIndexMarker1090" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> efficient learning from successes and failures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="calibre8">Centralized data governance benefits</h3>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Data security and privacy</strong>: Centralizing data governance ensures that there are consistent policies and <a id="_idIndexMarker1091" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>protocols in place to protect sensitive information and comply with privacy regulations. This is crucial in healthcare and other sectors where data privacy is paramount.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Data quality and integrity</strong>: A centralized approach to data governance helps maintain high data quality and integrity across the organization. By having uniform standards and policies, organizations can ensure that AI models are trained on accurate, clean, and reliable data.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Efficient resource management</strong>: Centralized data governance allows for more efficient management of data resources, avoiding duplication and ensuring that data assets are optimally utilized across the organization. This can lead to cost savings and more <a id="_idIndexMarker1092" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>efficient use of data storage and computing resources.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Regulatory compliance</strong>: With centralized data governance, organizations can more effectively ensure compliance with evolving regulatory requirements. A unified approach to data policymaking can help navigate complex legal landscapes and reduce the risk of non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6">By adopting a model that decentralizes AI work while centralizing data governance and policymaking, organizations such as Mayo Clinic can stimulate innovation and adaptability in AI applications while ensuring data security, quality, and regulatory compliance. This balanced <a id="_idIndexMarker1093" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>approach enables “innovation without regret,” allowing for the exploration and implementation of AI solutions in a responsible and effective manner.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-264" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor570" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q3 – Ethical concerns and strategies to combat over-delegation – as AI continues to penetrate daily decision-making processes, what strategies do you recommend to prevent overreliance on AI systems and to maintain a healthy level of human critical thinking and autonomy?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">The <strong class="bold">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMS</strong>) notice of proposed rulemaking is quite helpful in providing guidelines around the role of AI. John explains that “<em class="italic">The proposal says that all AI should augment, not replace, </em><em class="italic">human decision-making</em>.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">We dove into the proposal, presented online (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-08-04/pdf/2022-16217.pdf" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-08-04/pdf/2022-16217.pdf</a>). In particular, we focused on the <em class="italic">Use of Clinical Algorithms in Decision-Making (§ 92.210)</em> section on page 47880, and derived the following takeaways:</p>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Non-discrimination through clinical algorithms</strong>: CMS emphasizes that clinical algorithms should not result in discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. The use of clinical algorithms is not to be prohibited but monitored to prevent discriminatory outcomes.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Augmentation, not replacement</strong>: CMS proposes that clinical algorithms should augment, not replace, human clinical judgment. Overreliance on algorithms without considering their potential discriminatory impact could violate existing regulations.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Liability for decisions based on clinical algorithms</strong>: While entities are not liable for algorithms they did not develop, they may be held responsible for decisions made based on such algorithms if those decisions result in discrimination.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Awareness of algorithmic bias</strong>: CMS highlights the prevalence of “race correction” or “race norming” practices in clinical algorithms, which can lead to discriminatory treatment based on race or ethnicity. They advocate for the use of updated tools without <a id="_idIndexMarker1094" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>known biases.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Appropriate use of race and ethnicity-conscious variables</strong>: While race and ethnicity variables may be used in certain circumstances to address health disparities, CMS cautions against their use in ways that may result in discrimination.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Concerns with disabilities and age</strong>: Algorithms may also discriminate against individuals with disabilities and older adults, especially in crisis standards of care and resource allocation decisions during public health emergencies.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Proposed rule § 92.210</strong>: This new provision explicitly prohibits discrimination through the use of clinical algorithms, aiming to ensure that these tools do not replace clinical judgment or lead to discriminatory outcomes.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Guidance and technical assistance</strong>: CMS expresses a commitment to providing technical assistance to support compliance with civil rights obligations, seeking comments on the provision’s scope, measures for mitigation, and types of technical assistance needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6">In summary, CMS’s approach emphasizes the critical balance between leveraging AI for healthcare improvement and ensuring that these tools do not undermine human judgment or perpetuate discrimination. Their proposed rule and call for comments reflect an ongoing effort to develop responsive and responsible guidelines for AI’s role in healthcare <a id="_idIndexMarker1095" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-265" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor571" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Xavier Amatriain</h2>
<p class="calibre6">Let’s go through the questions and answers with Xavier Amatrian.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-266" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor572" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q1.1 – The future of LLM – hybrid learning paradigms: In light of the evolving landscape of learning schemes, what do you envision as the next breakthrough in combining different learning paradigms within LLMs?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">The most important thing to keep<a id="_idIndexMarker1096" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> in mind is that we are very early in the LLM research space and this is a rapidly evolving field. While attention-based transformers have taken us very far, there is room for many other approaches. For example, on the pre-training side, there is now a lot of interesting research in post-attention <a id="_idIndexMarker1097" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>approaches such as <strong class="bold">Structured State Space Models</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSMs</strong> or <strong class="bold">S4</strong>). Similarly, <strong class="bold">mixture of experts</strong> (<strong class="bold">MoEs</strong>), while not new, are<a id="_idIndexMarker1098" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> recently proving their incredible power to deliver smaller models that are very efficient, such as Mixtral by Mistral AI. And this is only in the pre-training space. For alignment, we have seen approaches such as <strong class="bold">Direct Preference</strong> (<strong class="bold">DP</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Kahneman Tversky</strong> (<strong class="bold">KT</strong>) show a lot of promise very quickly. Not to mention the use of self-play as a mechanism for improvement and alignment.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My main message here is that we should hold tight and expect a lot of innovation to come our way very fast in the<a id="_idIndexMarker1099" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> next few years. I think in a couple of years we will look back and think of the GPT4 architecture as something old and completely inefficient. Very importantly, some of these improvements will make LLMs better in accuracy, but also much more efficient in cost and size so we should expect to have GPT4-like models running on our phones.</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">Q1.2 – The future of LLM – specialized LLMs in ensemble approaches: Considering a K-LLMs approach, that is, the notion of using multiple LLMs with complementary strengths, what specific criteria should guide the selection and combination of LLMs in an ensemble to tackle complex tasks?</h3>
<p class="calibre6">There are many ways and places where ensemble techniques can and will be used in the context of LLMs. The criteria to select and combine them depends on the uses and where this combination happens. Here are three places where combining LLMs is useful:</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the pre-training phase, <strong class="bold">Mixtures of Experts</strong> (<strong class="bold">MoEs</strong>) are <a id="_idIndexMarker1100" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>a form of ensemble where different deep neural networks are combined to improve the output. The weights to select and weigh the different experts are learned during pre-training. Importantly, some of those weights are zero, making inference much more efficient since not all experts are needed for all tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Another way to combine different LLMs is during the distillation phase. In some approaches such as teacher/student distillation, LLMs are used to generate data to then train a smaller or more specific model. The selection and weight of each LLM is learned during the training phase of the student model.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Finally, we can combine LLMs at the application layer by treating each LLM instance as an agent. This leads to the notion of multi-agent systems where LLM-powered agents that are specialized for a task are combined to do a more complex one.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-267" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor573" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q2 – AI-driven organizational structure – in what ways do you predict AI will continue to reshape internal business operations, and how should companies prepare to adapt their organizational structures to maximize the benefits of AI, especially in decision-making and operational efficiency?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">Generative AI is going to revolutionize every aspect of organizations. My strong prediction is that AI is going to become another member of the organization. For example, software engineers <a id="_idIndexMarker1101" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>will collaborate with an AI (or several of them) in their day to day. This will make them not 10X but 100X more efficient.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Of course, such a revolutionary force will change how we organize teams, hire people, or evaluate their performance. I think it is very important that we prepare for a world coming very soon where a very important skill for anyone in an organization will be their ability to collaborate and work with AI.</p>

<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Economic risks</strong>: The economic implications of AI are vast, ranging from the infringement of IP rights to the potential for increased market concentration and unemployment. These risks highlight the transformative impact of AI on the competitive landscape and labor markets.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Security risks</strong>: AI’s misuse by malevolent actors represents a significant security concern. This includes the utilization of AI for creating chemical nerve agents or conducting <a id="_idIndexMarker1105" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>data-extraction attacks, where LLMs might be exploited to access private personal information, thereby compromising data privacy and security.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Existential risks</strong>: Perhaps the most profound risk is the existential threat posed by AI systems that surpass human intelligence. Such systems, if not adequately aligned with human values and objectives, might pursue their goals in ways that have catastrophic outcomes for humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre6">Recognizing the breadth and depth of these risks is crucial for countries, developers, and society at large to ensure that the deployment of AI technologies proceeds in a manner that minimizes potential harm. This necessitates a proactive approach to governance, development practices, and societal engagement to navigate the complex landscape of AI advancements responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-271" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor577" class="calibre5 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Q3 – How can the development and deployment of AI and LLMs be guided to mitigate ethical concerns such as bias and ensure their responsible use in decision-making processes, particularly in high-risk and regulated industries?</h2>
<p class="calibre6">To mitigate ethical concerns such as bias and ensure the responsible use of AI and LLMs in decision-making processes, especially in high-risk and regulated industries, a multifaceted approach is required. This approach should address both technical and socio-technical challenges posed by the integration of AI systems into critical areas of business and society. The following strategies can guide the development and deployment of AI systems:</p>
<ul class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Development focus shift</strong>: AI systems should be designed to augment rather than replicate human thinking. This shift in focus can help maintain public trust in AI by ensuring that AI systems support and enhance human decision-making rather than replace it. Trust is crucial for the long-term integration of AI in decision-making processes, and maintaining it requires a clear demonstration of AI’s complementary role to human capabilities.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Regulatory compliance and bias mitigation</strong>: Adherence to emerging regulations, such as the EU AI Act which was passed in 2024, and agreed standards which aim to limit bias in high-risk use cases, is essential. Developers should also be mindful of the broader implications of bias, beyond regulatory compliance, recognizing the challenges posed by Western- and English-centric AI systems. Efforts should be made to diversify datasets and algorithms to reflect global demographics and reduce inherent biases.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Stress testing and security measures</strong>: AI systems, particularly LLMs, should undergo rigorous stress testing to ensure they can handle high-risk use cases with more deterministic outcomes.
