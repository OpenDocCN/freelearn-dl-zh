			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Boost Coding Efficiency for JSON, YAML, and HCL with Auto-Code Generation</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following key topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An overview of <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) languages</li>
				<li>JSON and YAML auto-code generation for AWS CloudFormation using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>HCL auto-code generation for Terraform using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>JSON, YAML, and HCL code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> the <strong class="bold">command-line interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLI</strong>) and shell scripting using two user personas: system administrators and shell script programmers. We introduced how auto-code generation through Amazon Q Developer can assist these professionals. Using the Amazon Q Developer CLI, we demonstrated how to achieve various administrative tasks such as disk space management, user management, process management, library management, and more. Additionally, we generated an end-to-end shell script utilizing chain-of-thought prompts, single-line prompts, and multi-line prompt techniques.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore different categories of programming languages associated with IaC. In IaC, the programming languages are tightly coupled with the tools or services used. Firstly, we will focus on JSON and YAML, which are used by the AWS CloudFormation service. Then, we will explore HCL, which is used by Terraform. We will introduce how auto-code generation through Amazon Q Developer can help understand the basics, learn the syntax, and automatically generate code using JSON, YAML, and HCL. Then, we will explore code explainability to support documentation and code optimization recommendations provided by Amazon Q Developer for IaC programmers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Overview of IaC languages</h1>
			<p>In<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> today’s cloud computing landscape, IaC has emerged as a fundamental paradigm shift in managing and provisioning infrastructure. AWS CloudFormation and Terraform are two leading IaC tools that enable developers and system administrators to define and manage cloud resources programmatically, treating infrastructure as software.</p>
			<p>AWS CloudFormation<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> simplifies the provisioning and management of AWS resources using declarative JSON or YAML templates. These templates define the configuration and interdependencies of AWS services, enabling users to provision multiple resources predictably and repeatably. CloudFormation automates the creation, updating, and deletion of infrastructure stacks, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors in resource provisioning.</p>
			<p>Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, takes a broader approach by supporting multiple cloud providers (including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform) and on-premises infrastructure. It uses a declarative language called <strong class="bold">HashiCorp Configuration Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">HCL</strong>) to<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> define infrastructure as code. Terraform’s state management capabilities allow it to plan and execute changes to infrastructure with minimal downtime and manage complex dependencies between resources across different providers.</p>
			<p>Both AWS CloudFormation and Terraform play critical roles in enabling organizations to achieve IaC principles, including versioning, automation, and scalability. They facilitate collaborative development practices, integrate with CI/CD pipelines, and enable the management of infrastructure configurations as code repositories. IaC developers can leverage various prompt techniques and chat-style integration with Amazon Q Developer to enhance AWS CloudFormation and Terraform capabilities in several key areas. Amazon Q Developer automates the generation of AWS CloudFormation templates and Terraform configurations based on specific infrastructure requirements. Using natural language processing and chat-style interactions, developers can specify infrastructure needs and receive generated code that adheres to best practices and architectural guidelines. Beyond basic template generation, Amazon Q Developer offers optimization suggestions and enforces best practices for AWS CloudFormation and Terraform configurations. It analyzes generated code, identifies potential performance bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities, and provides recommendations to optimize infrastructure deployments.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Amazon Q Developer serves as an educational resource for learning IaC principles and <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>mastering AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. It offers interactive tutorials, explanations of IaC concepts, and practical examples through its intuitive interface. This educational aspect helps developers and system administrators improve their proficiency in efficiently and securely managing cloud resources. Additionally, by integrating Amazon Q Developer with AWS CloudFormation and Terraform, teams benefit from standardized templates, shared infrastructure configurations, and streamlined code review processes. This integration enhances collaboration between development, operations, and security teams, ensuring that infrastructure changes are implemented consistently and securely. As cloud environments evolve, Amazon Q Developer continuously updates its recommendations and capabilities to align with the latest best practices and architectural patterns in AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. This ensures that organizations can leverage cutting-edge infrastructure management techniques and maintain operational excellence in cloud deployments.</p>
			<p>Let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help an IaC developer. To illustrate, I am going to use the Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> for configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code). Additionally, for information on the Terraform Extension for Visual Studio Code, please refer to the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of the chapter.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs, which, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers/code blocks shown in the code snapshots; try to update prompts to get desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer/code should meet the requirements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>JSON and YAML auto-code generation for AWS CloudFormation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Similar to the previous chapter, let’s assume that a new IaC developer plans to work with JSON and YAML coding to build infrastructure on the AWS cloud using AWS CloudFormation but lacks background knowledge about this service. We will use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate IaC developers. They can simply ask questions in natural language to learn about AWS CloudFormation and its support for JSON and YAML.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>AWS CloudFormation basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s first learn about <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>AWS CloudFormation:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is AWS CloudFormation and what is it use for?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.1 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation basic" src="img/B21378_09_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation basic</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer provided an overview of the AWS CloudFormation service: “<strong class="bold">AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to model and provision a collection of related AWS and third-party resources using templates. It enables you to define and manage your infrastructure as code, making it easier to create, update, and delete resources in a consistent and </strong><strong class="bold">repeatable manner</strong><strong class="bold">”</strong><strong class="bold">.</strong></p>
			<p>Additionally, Amazon Q Developer listed some AWS resources that can be provisioned using AWS CloudFormation. Then, it provided the key features of AWS CloudFormation, including IaC, automated provisioning, resource orchestration, reusability and modularity, change management, rollback, and deletion. Furthermore, it highlighted the use of JSON and YAML templates as common programming mechanisms.</p>
			<p>So, now, let’s ask <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>Amazon Q Developer to provide more information about the AWS resources supported by AWS CloudFormation using JSON and YAML templates:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Which AWS resources AWS CloudFormation support using JSON and YAML templates?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.2 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation AWS resources" src="img/B21378_09_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation AWS resources</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer gave a well-formatted answer with specifications related to categories of resources such as compute, networking, storage, databases, analytics, security, application services, and management, and sample resources from each of those categories that are supported by AWS CloudFormation using JSON and YAML.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>JSON auto-code generation</h2>
			<p>Based<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> on the previous information, an IaC developer now understands the support provided by AWS CloudFormation for provisioning resources using JSON. As the next step, let’s begin writing a JSON template for AWS CloudFormation to create a simple AWS resource.</p>
			<p>Let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to create JSON code for a commonly requested AWS resource such as an S3 bucket from a storage resource and a networking component such as VPC. For customization, use the specific S3 bucket name, VPC name, and the CIDR block as <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>. We will use prompts to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create an AWS CloudFormation JSON template to create an S3 bucket named <code>"MyTestBucket"</code>.</li>
				<li>Create an AWS CloudFormation JSON template to create a <code>"MyTestVPC"</code> VPC with a CIDR block of <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To illustrate, I will use the VS Code script editor integrated with Amazon Q Developer. As these are relatively easy requirements, let’s use single-line prompts for each of the preceding resources:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt 1:
/* Write AWS CloudFormation JSON code to
create s3 bucket "MyTestBucket" */
Prompt 2:
/* Write AWS CloudFormation JSON code to
create Amazon VPC "MyTestVPC" with CIDR block "10.0.0.0/16" */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.3 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation JSON, S3 and VPC" src="img/B21378_09_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation JSON, S3 and VPC</p>
			<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided the correct end-to-end JSON template syntax for S3 and VPC. It used specific keywords supported by AWS CloudFormation to provision these resources, such as <code>"AWS::S3::Bucket"</code> and <code>"AWS::EC2::VPC"</code>, which combine the resource type and the corresponding parent service name. Additionally, it used the required properties to meet our requirements, such as <code>"BucketName"</code> set to <code>"MyTestBucket"</code> and <code>"CidrBlock"</code> with the value <code>"10.0.0.0/16"</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>YAML auto-code generation</h2>
			<p>YAML is<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> another language supported by AWS CloudFormation for provisioning resources. As the next step, let’s begin writing a YAML template for AWS CloudFormation to create a simple AWS resource. We’ll use the same requirements for the Amazon S3 bucket and VPC creation as we did for the JSON template. Now, let’s modify our<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> prompts to instruct Amazon Q Developer to generate a YAML template.</p>
			<p>Similar to the previous example, I will use the VS Code script editor integrated with Amazon Q Developer and utilize single-line prompts for each of these resources:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt 1:
/* Write AWS CloudFormation YAML code to create s3 bucket "MyTestBucket" */
Prompt 2:
/* Write AWS CloudFormation YAML code to create Amazon VPC "MyTestVPC" with CIDR block "10.0.0.0/16" */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.4 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation YAML, S3 and VPC" src="img/B21378_09_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4 – Prompt – IaC AWS CloudFormation YAML, S3 and VPC</p>
			<p>Notice in the preceding screenshot that Amazon Q Developer created an end-to-end YAML script for S3 and the VPC. It used specific keywords supported by AWS CloudFormation<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> to provision these resources, such as <code>AWS::S3::Bucket</code> and <code>AWS::EC2::VPC</code>, which combine the resource type and the corresponding parent service name. Additionally, it used the required properties to meet our requirements, such as <code>BucketName</code> set to <code>mytestbucket</code> and <code>CidrBlock</code> with the value <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>.</p>
			<p>If you compare the YAML template screenshot (<em class="italic">Figure 9</em><em class="italic">.4</em>) with the JSON template screenshot (<em class="italic">Figure 9</em><em class="italic">.3</em>), you will notice that Amazon Q Developer included additional properties in the YAML version. Due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, Amazon Q Developer may add extra properties. However, it always includes the necessary properties to meet your requirements. If desired, you can adjust the prompts to add further requirements and receive recommendations with additional properties.</p>
			<p>We will revisit the JSON template in the <em class="italic">JSON, YAML, and HCL code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</em> section to review additional recommendations.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>HCL auto-code generation for Terraform using Amazon 
Q Developer</h1>
			<p>We’ll follow the theme to start with a basic knowledge of the language in this section, too. I’ll first assume the persona of a new IaC developer who is planning to work with HCL by Terraform and does not have any background with the tool.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Terraform basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate IaC developers, where they can simply ask questions in natural language to learn about Terraform.</p>
			<p>Let’s first learn about Terraform from Amazon Q Developer:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is Terraform and what is it use for?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.5 – Prompt – IaC Terraform basic partial screenshot" src="img/B21378_09_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.5 – Prompt – IaC Terraform basic partial screenshot</p>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> can see in the preceding partial screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided basic information: “<strong class="bold">Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It is used for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers</strong>”. Then, it listed the use cases and features supported by Terraform such as infrastructure provisioning, IaC, multi-cloud support, resource lifecycle management, state management, dependency handling, and more.</p>
			<p>Now, based on the information from Amazon Q Developer’s answer, as an IaC developer, we understand that it used HCL to create resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises, including AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, RDS databases, and more.</p>
			<p>Let’s now ask Amazon Q Developer to list the different AWS resources that are supported by HCL:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Which AWS resources are supported by Terraform HCL?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.6 – Prompt – IaC Terraform AWS resources" src="img/B21378_09_6.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.6 – Prompt – IaC Terraform AWS resources</p>
			<p>Notice that<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> Amazon Q Developer provided a categorized list including compute, networking, storage, databases, analytics, security, application services, and management, and sample resources within each category supported by Terraform HCL.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>HCL auto-code generation</h2>
			<p>Based on <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>the preceding basic information from Amazon Q Developer, HCL is the language supported by Terraform to provision multiple AWS cloud resources including Amazon S3 buckets and VPCs. As the next step, let’s use the same requirements for the S3 bucket and VPC creation as we used in the previous section on AWS CloudFormation with JSON.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s modify our prompts to instruct Amazon Q Developer to generate an HCL template. Similar to the previous example, I will use the VS Code script editor integrated with Amazon Q Developer and utilize single-line prompts for each of these resources:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt 1:
/* Write Terraform HCL to create s3 bucket "MyTestBucket" */
Prompt 2:
/* Write Terraform HCL code to create Amazon VPC "MyTestVPC" with CIDR block "10.0.0.0/16" */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.7 – Prompt – IaC Terraform HCL, S3 and VPC" src="img/B21378_09_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.7 – Prompt – IaC Terraform HCL, S3 and VPC</p>
			<p>Observe <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>that the HCL end-to-end code provided by Amazon Q Developer used Terraform modules and corresponding required properties. It used <code>resource "aws_s3_bucket"</code>, <code>resource "aws_vpc"</code>, <code>bucket = "MyTestBucket"</code>, and <code>cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"</code> to meet the exact specification provided in the prompt. Feel free to update prompts to get specific HCL code recommendations from Amazon Q Developer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>JSON, YAML, and HCL code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> offers a<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> simple interface for achieving code explainability and optimization and supports AWS CloudFormation scripts with JSON and YAML templates and Terraform HCL. For more details on explainability and optimization, please refer to <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<p>To illustrate, I am going<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> to use the code that was auto-generated during the AWS CloudFormation JSON creation task. As shown in the following screenshot, highlight the code, right-click to open the pop-up menu, select <strong class="bold">Amazon Q</strong>, and choose <strong class="bold">Explain</strong> for code explainability or <strong class="bold">Optimize</strong> for optimization recommendations.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.8 – JSON, YAML, and HCL – Amazon Q explainability and optimization" src="img/B21378_09_8.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.8 – JSON, YAML, and HCL – Amazon Q explainability and optimization</p>
			<p>This will pop up Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface and move the full code for analysis.</p>
			<p>For explainability, Amazon Q Developer recognizes two distinct templates and segregates each block accordingly, offering detailed information that can be utilized for documentation and <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>resource specifications. For instance, Amazon Q Developer provided the following details for the S3 bucket section: “<strong class="bold">This template defines a single resource named MyTestBucket of type AWS::S3::Bucket. The Properties section specifies the properties for the S3 bucket resource. In this case, it sets the BucketName property to “MyTestBucket”, which will be the name of the S3 </strong><strong class="bold">bucket created</strong>”.</p>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>optimization, Amazon Q Developer recommended several additional properties to enhance the security, functionality, and organizational structure of the CloudFormation templates, while maintaining their core purpose of creating an S3 bucket and a VPC. Here are some key enhancements suggested: “<strong class="bold">Enable S3 Bucket Encryption: Implement server-side encryption with AES256 for enhanced data security, Configure VPC DNS Support: Enable EnableDnsHostnames and EnableDnsSupport to ensure proper DNS resolution within the VPC, Set VPC Instance Tenancy: Set the tenancy to default, which is recommended for most use cases, and Implement Tagging: Add tags to resources for improved identification and </strong><strong class="bold">organization purposes</strong>”.</p>
			<p>Additionally, Amazon Q Developer generated an updated end-to-end script incorporating all the preceding changes, which you can add directly by clicking the <strong class="bold">Insert at </strong><strong class="bold">cursor</strong> button.</p>
			<p>In addition to JSON, YAML, and HCL for IaC, Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>supports <strong class="bold">AWS Cloud Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDK</strong>) (TypeScript and Python), and multiple other programming languages. There are many enhancements happening in this area, and we anticipate further enhancements in support for additional languages (check the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of the chapter).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Summary</h1>
