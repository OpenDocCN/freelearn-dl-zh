			<p><em class="italic">Learn Robotics Programming</em> is about building and programming a robot with smart behavior. It covers the skills required to make and build a gadget from parts, including how to choose them. These parts include sensors, motors, cameras, microphones, speakers, lights, and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
			<p>This book continues with how to write code to make those parts do something interesting. The book uses Python, together with a little bit of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. </p>
			<p>The technology used is intended to include things that are available and affordable and the code is shown to demonstrate concepts, so they can be used and combined to create even more interesting code and robots. </p>
			<p>The topics combine aspects of being a programmer with aspects of being a robot maker, with a number of specialist topics such as computer vision and voice assistants thrown in. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for someone with a little programming experience, or someone more experienced but looking to apply their skills to a hardware project. You do not need to be an expert-level programmer, but do have to have written some lines of code and be comfortable with looping, conditionals, and functions. Knowledge of object-oriented- (class- and object-) based programming isn't necessary but is introduced in the book.</p>
			<p>The book does not require a specialist workshop, although there will be a little soldering and bolting things together. This will be introduced later in the book. </p>
			<p>You do not need to have any experience at all with electronics or making things, but hopefully, you'll have a healthy interest in learning more, since some very basic concepts are introduced throughout the book. Being keen to build a robot, get it to do stuff, and find out what to do with it next is probably the most important aspect of the book.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Before you begin with this book, you need to have programmed a little in a text programming language. I am assuming some familiarity with variables, conditional statements, looping, and functions. </p>
			<p>You will need a computer, running macOS, Linux, or Windows, an internet connection, and Wi-Fi.</p>
			<p>In terms of manual skills, I assume that you can use a screwdriver, that you can deal with occasional fiddly operations, and that you won't be too scared off by the possibility of soldering things.</p>
			<p>Code examples have been tested on Python 3 with Raspbian Buster and Picroft Buster Keaton. The book will show you how to install these when needed. The book will show you how to choose and find robot parts when needed too.</p>
