			<p>In any organization, software development is not just about writing code. The software engineering process also involves something known as DevOps. It is a combination of “development” and “operations,” involving a set of practices aimed at improving collaboration and communication between software <strong class="bold">development</strong> (<strong class="bold">Dev</strong>) and IT <strong class="bold">operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">Ops</strong>) teams. It focuses on automating processes, increasing efficiency, and delivering high-quality software products more quickly and reliably.</p>
			<p>DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration, <strong class="bold">continuous integration and continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>), the automation of infrastructure and workflows, and monitoring and feedback loops to enable faster development cycles, improved deployment frequency, and more stable operating environments.</p>
			<p>Many tools are available in the marketplace to serve various purposes in the DevOps life cycle, including version control, continuous integration, continuous delivery, configuration management, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and collaboration. AWS also has a service called Amazon CodeCatalyst that helps with this process. But first, we need to understand some of the challenges faced during the DevOps process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Challenges during the DevOps process</h1>
			<p>Even though<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> DevOps tools help in many aspects of the software development process, some challenges still persist during this process. Let’s understand some of the challenges so that you will appreciate what Amazon Q brings to the DevOps process in CodeCatalyst:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity</strong>: Many DevOps tools can be complex to set up, configure, and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and skills. For instance, setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins involves multiple steps: installing and configuring Jenkins on a server, integrating it with version control systems such as Git, setting up build scripts, configuring plugins for various stages of the pipeline, managing user permissions, and ensuring the server is secure and regularly updated. This process can be time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of both Jenkins and the underlying infrastructure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration issues</strong>: Integrating multiple DevOps tools into a cohesive pipeline can be challenging, leading to compatibility issues and data silos.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Limited automation</strong>: While automation is a key principle of DevOps, not all tools offer robust automation capabilities, leading to manual workarounds and inefficiencies. For instance, consider a scenario where a team uses a deployment tool that lacks automated rollback features. If a deployment fails, team members must manually intervene to revert the system to a previous stable state. This manual process can be time-consuming and prone to errors and disrupt the streamlined workflow that DevOps aims to achieve. As a result, the lack of robust automation in the tool leads to inefficiencies and increased operational overhead.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Learning curve</strong>: DevOps tools often have steep learning curves, requiring time and resources for teams to become proficient in their use, which can slow down adoption and implementation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of collaboration</strong>: Siloed teams and departments can hinder collaboration and communication, leading to inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the DevOps pipeline.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous testing</strong>: Implementing comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and automated regression tests, can be challenging, particularly in complex environments with frequent code changes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Skills gap</strong>: Finding and retaining skilled DevOps professionals with expertise in automation, cloud computing, containerization, and other relevant technologies can be challenging in a competitive job market.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s quickly understand <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>the basics of Amazon CodeCatalyst so that it’s easy to understand how Amazon Q can accelerate the DevOps process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Introduction to Amazon CodeCatalyst</h1>
			<p>Amazon CodeCatalyst<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> streamlines software development for teams embracing continuous integration and continuous delivery practices. By consolidating essential tools, it simplifies work planning, code collaboration, and application development with built-in CI/CD capabilities. Seamlessly integrating AWS resources into projects is facilitated through direct connections with AWS accounts. This all-in-one tool manages every stage and facet of the application life cycle, enabling swift and assured software delivery.</p>
			<p>The following figure highlights all the different aspects of software development that CodeCatalyst helps with.</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.1 – Amazon CodeCatalyst capabilities</p>
			<p>Let’s walk through <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>some of the key things that CodeCatalyst can do. These are also referenced in the AWS documentation for CodeCatalyst, a link to which is provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of the chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Code collaboration</strong>: Collaborate seamlessly with your team on code through branches, merges, pull requests, and comments in your source code repositories. Quickly create development environments to work on code without the need to clone or set up connections to repositories.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build, test, and deploy an application with workflows</strong>: Define workflows with build, test, and deploy actions to manage the CI/CD of your applications. Initiate workflows manually or set them to start automatically based on events such as code pushes or the creation or closing of pull requests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritize work with issue tracking</strong>: Use issues to establish backlogs and track the status of ongoing tasks with boards. Maintaining a healthy backlog of items for your team to address is integral to software development.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring and notifications</strong>: Monitor team activity and resource status, and configure notifications to remain informed about important changes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Amazon CodeCatalyst is a<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> comprehensive service with multiple capabilities and features. Providing a detailed overview is beyond the scope of this book. However, if you are interested in exploring CodeCatalyst as a DevOps tool, feel free to go through the workshop that is listed in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
			<p>To fast-track learning and see CodeCatalyst in action, multiple blueprints are provided within the service. These blueprints will create all the infrastructure needed to implement an end-to-end DevOps process for a specific use case. One such blueprint is for implementing a modern three-tier web application. You can find a step-by-step tutorial for it in the link provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section.</p>
			<p>With the introduction to DevOps done, let’s jump straight into the theme of this chapter: how Amazon Q can help with the DevOps process inside Amazon CodeCatalyst.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Exploring Amazon Q’s capabilities in Amazon CodeCatalyst</h1>
			<p>If your project<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> resides in a source repository within Amazon CodeCatalyst, GitHub Cloud, or Bitbucket Cloud, and Amazon Q features are enabled, you can leverage some of Q’s capabilities to expedite the DevOps process. Developers often face time constraints, leading to a backlog of tasks. Consequently, they may overlook providing detailed explanations for code changes in pull requests, assuming their peers will decipher them independently. Likewise, both pull request creators and reviewers may lack sufficient time to thoroughly analyze comments, especially in cases of multiple revisions.</p>
			<p>In modern software development, engineers encounter significant challenges during the DevOps process, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. One prominent issue is the time-consuming nature of code review and collaboration within teams. Software engineers often struggle to provide comprehensive explanations for their code changes in pull requests, while reviewers face difficulties in thoroughly analyzing and understanding the changes, particularly in cases with multiple revisions. These inefficiencies result in delays, reduced productivity, and missed opportunities for innovation. Additionally, adding new features to the code is a time-consuming process; at the same time, reviewers may face difficulties in comprehending complex changes, especially when dealing with large code bases.</p>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>Amazon Q integration with Amazon CodeCatalyst, team members can streamline their workflows, allowing more time to focus on critical aspects of their work. We are in the infancy stage of incorporating Amazon Q into the DevOps process, but so far, here are some of the key features of Amazon Q that work with Amazon CodeCatalyst:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature development</strong>: Enables developers to input ideas in an issue and get fully tested application code that is ready for merge in a pull request. With just a few clicks and inputs in natural language, the whole workflow is simplified.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auto-generate a pull request summary</strong>: Amazon Q can analyze all comments left on code changes within a pull request and generate a concise summary of the feedback.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auto-generate a pull request description</strong>: Amazon Q can analyze the code changes and generate a description of the changes in the pull request, making it easier to review and approve changes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are other areas where Q assists within CodeCatalyst, such as auto-selecting blueprints and providing task recommendations. We will go through each of these features in detail in this chapter. But first, as always, another reminder about the non-deterministic nature of LLM-generated output.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Reminder</p>
			<p class="callout">Before we start showcasing Amazon Q’s capabilities with CodeCatalyst, it is important to remember a few things. Responses received from LLMs are generally not idempotent. Idempotence refers to the property of an operation where applying it multiple times has the same effect as applying it once.</p>
			<p class="callout">In the context of LLMs, each response generated is based on the specific input prompt provided at that moment. While the same prompt may produce similar or related responses across multiple iterations, there is no guarantee that the responses will be identical each time. Factors such as model initialization, randomization, and the specific context of the prompt can influence the variations in the generated responses.</p>
			<p class="callout">Therefore, even in the example we will be using in the following sections, if you send the same prompt to Amazon Q, you may receive different responses each time, making the responses non-idempotent. Use your own judgment on what to accept as accurate and what to prompt the system again for to receive a revised approach, before you proceed to try out all the steps.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s start<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> with the feature development capability in Amazon CodeCatalyst, our DevOps service, in which generative AI capabilities of Amazon Q are already enabled.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Amazon Q’s feature development capability in Amazon CodeCatalyst</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>feature development capability in Amazon Q enables users to customize and enhance Q’s question-answering skills for specific domains. Concerning the DevOps process using Amazon CodeCatalyst, feature development could entail issuing a fix to a bug identified in the application, making improvements, or adding new functionality. For all these tasks, the <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>code base requires alteration, testing, troubleshooting for any issues during this process, and then pushing the changes back into production for deployment. While it may seem straightforward, in large code bases with many components and insufficient comments for clarity, especially for newly onboarded developers, completing the end-to-end task quickly becomes challenging.</p>
			<p>Let’s walk through an example of how Amazon Q assists with feature development inside Amazon CodeCatalyst. Here, we assume that you have a basic understanding of the different components of CodeCatalyst. If this is your first time using the service, we encourage you to try out the workshop linked in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter. Once you complete those, you will be able to relate better to some of the aspects we discuss in this section. Let’s jump straight to the use case.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Use case for leveraging Amazon Q feature development in Amazon CodeCatalyst</h2>
			<p>To demonstrate<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> the feature development capability, we will select the AWS Glue ETL blueprint available when you create a project. We’ve chosen this example to provide a comprehensive view of how developers can expedite their ETL code in Glue. Additional techniques for accelerating coding with Glue are covered in <a href="B21378_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor210"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the AWS Glue ETL blueprint inside CodeCatalyst.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.2 – Glue ETL blueprint in Amazon CodeCatalyst" src="img/B21378_16_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.2 – Glue ETL blueprint in Amazon CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>In this example, since we already knew which blueprint we wanted, it was easy for us to read the description and select it for our project. However, some use cases may require us to read the descriptions of multiple available blueprints before selecting the most appropriate one. Amazon Q now assists you in creating a project by auto-selecting the best-matching blueprint based on the criteria you provide in natural language. Q will analyze <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>the descriptions of all the blueprints and select the best one for you to create a project with, thus saving you valuable time.</p>
			<p>The following example highlights the project creation process with Amazon Q suggesting the Glue blueprint based on the criteria we provided in the chat.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.3 – Glue ETL blueprint suggestion by Amazon Q" src="img/B21378_16_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.3 – Glue ETL blueprint suggestion by Amazon Q</p>
			<p>Once you have completed the steps, the source code repository will be set up, and a CI/CD pipeline via a workflow will have been completed. The pipeline essentially initiates an AWS CloudFormation stack using the AWS <strong class="bold">Cloud Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDK</strong>) code stored within the repository.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot depicts the Glue ETL blueprint after its setup in CodeCatalyst. The architecture of this ETL project is also explained in the overview. It’s a straightforward project where input data is processed using AWS Glue and stored in Amazon S3 in Parquet file format for querying by Amazon Athena. The workflow status at the bottom of the screen indicates completion, signifying that the CloudFormation stack has successfully deployed all the components of the architecture. You can navigate to the AWS Lambda and AWS Glue service consoles in AWS to inspect the artifacts.</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.4 – Glue ETL blueprint deployed using Amazon CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>Notice <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>the <strong class="bold">Add with Amazon Q</strong> option (at the top right of the preceding screenshot), which allows you to add new components by suggesting other blueprints based on your desired requirements. For this use case, let’s assume we found everything we wanted in this single blueprint, so we will work with what we already have.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s assume that we have some enhancements to make in our Glue ETL pipeline. Constant enhancements and improvements to solutions are always encouraged, so we will also do something similar.</p>
			<p>The Glue ETL blueprint stores the final output in the Parquet file format, which is widely used to set up data lakes. However, as the volume of processed and stored data increases, so does the storage cost. To enhance the storage efficiency of these Parquet files, compression algorithms can be applied to store them in a compressed format. However, determining the optimal compression algorithm that balances storage savings with performance can be challenging for developers. Without clear guidance on how to approach this task and test the compression-to-performance ratio, developers may spend considerable time on research before implementing changes. Alternatively, they can seek<a id="_idIndexMarker717"/> quick solutions by consulting Amazon Q’s feature development capability, integrated into CodeCatalyst.</p>
			<p>The following figure provides a good workflow of how Amazon Q helps with feature development.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.5 – Amazon Q feature development workflow" src="img/B21378_16_05.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.5 – Amazon Q feature development workflow</p>
			<p>Let’s understand all these steps in detail and see how Amazon Q can expedite this laborious DevOps process for the Glue project we have selected in this chapter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Assigning issues to Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>Say <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>an ETL developer knows that they need to apply some compression logic to the code but is unsure which algorithm to apply. Also, the developer is not sure what code would need to be changed throughout the code base. This is where Amazon Q can help. The developer will create an <strong class="bold">issue</strong> in CodeCatalyst and describe their issue in as much detail as possible.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows an issue that we would create with a title and description of what our end goal is.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.6 – Create an issue in Amazon CodeCatalyst and assign it to Amazon Q" src="img/B21378_16_6.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.6 – Create an issue in Amazon CodeCatalyst and assign it to Amazon Q</p>
			<p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>keep the status as <strong class="bold">To do</strong> and the priority as <strong class="bold">No priority</strong> as the default options for now. Note that instead of assigning this to a user, we have the option to assign this to Amazon Q instead.</p>
			<p>Once it’s assigned to Amazon Q, it wants us to specify how it should proceed with the flow. First, we provided the source repository that this issue should work against. Then, it’s asking whether the user wants to review code change suggestions along the way. Based on user comments, Q can adjust its approach a certain number of times. For the vast majority of cases, it’s always good to keep this option enabled as the suggestions may not always align with our desired code. Next, it’s also asking whether Q can modify the workflow files on its own. In this case, we disabled this just to be on the safe side. Q can now also recommend tasks based on its analysis of the issue. For now, we’ll keep it turned off but we will look at this option again during the next stage.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows our selection when we assign the issue to Amazon Q.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.7 – Initial input required by Amazon to proceed with the issue" src="img/B21378_16_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.7 – Initial input required by Amazon to proceed with the issue</p>
			<p>Once we <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>confirm our selection and create the issue, Amazon Q moves the issue to the <strong class="bold">In progress</strong> lane, as highlighted in the following screenshot.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.8 – Issue being analyzed by Amazon Q in the In progress lane" src="img/B21378_16_8.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.8 – Issue being analyzed by Amazon Q in the In progress lane</p>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>step is to generate an approach to solve the issue and provide the developer with the option to provide any feedback via prompts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Generating an approach and providing feedback</h2>
			<p>This step is <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>where all the real magic happens behind the scenes. Q will first evaluate any prerequisites and<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> then proceed to read the code repository you provided in the previous step.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the approach Q will take to reach the end goal. Observe that it waits for the user’s response before it can proceed further.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.9 – Amazon Q analyzing steps when the issue is assigned to it in CodeCatalyst" src="img/B21378_16_9.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.9 – Amazon Q analyzing steps when the issue is assigned to it in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Recommend tasks</strong> button is also presented on this screen, where Q can analyze the issue <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>and assign more manageable tasks to users for faster actions. In our use case here, we don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>need to use this feature, but feel free to try it out for more complex issues you want to create in your workplace.</p>
			<p>Based on what it learned, it will generate a summary background of what it understood about the project. The following screenshot highlights the background generated for the AWS Glue ETL project.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.10 – Amazon Q background generation step in CodeCatalyst" src="img/B21378_16_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.10 – Amazon Q background generation step in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>background is helpful in summarizing what the code base is all about. The next step is <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>the main one, as it presents the approach it would take to solve the issue that was provided as input in the description of the issue.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the approach for the compression use case we presented to Q.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.11 – Amazon Q-generated approach in CodeCatalyst – part 1" src="img/B21378_16_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.11 – Amazon Q-generated approach in CodeCatalyst – part 1</p>
			<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>end of the step, once you understand the changes proposed by Q, you have two options. In <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>some cases, Q will provide perfect choices and everything proposed may seem 100% accurate. In such cases, you can simply proceed. However, it’s important to keep in mind, as we have been constantly reminded, that LLM-based solutions may not always be exactly what you want, but Q is willing to learn and provide better or alternative solutions. This is where prompt engineering comes in, and Amazon Q allows you to provide prompts via the comments section so that it can modify its approach and provide a different solution.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the options Q presents for its generated approach. For our use case, we will accept the approach Q presented and proceed to the next step.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.12 – Amazon Q-generated approach in CodeCatalyst – part 2" src="img/B21378_16_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.12 – Amazon Q-generated approach in CodeCatalyst – part 2</p>
			<p>Observe <a id="_idIndexMarker730"/>how Amazon Q systematically lays down possible next steps. Firstly, it understood our <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>requirement and suggested using Snappy compression, which would provide a good balance between compression and speed. It then provided code snippets that will need to be added or changed in every source code file to make this work. For developers, researching possible solutions to a problem and understanding all the places where code changes are required can take a significant amount of time and effort. Amazon Q did all this on our behalf in just a few minutes.</p>
			<p>To add a bit of intrigue, one of the code snippets provided in the approach seems to have a problem. I could have provided additional prompts and attempted to get Amazon Q to provide me with the exact code that would work. However, in real life, sometimes issues slip through the cracks. But don’t worry; we will have another opportunity to<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> fix this at a later stage. This also demonstrates how Q provides <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>other features to move toward the perfect final solution within CodeCatalyst.</p>
			<p>For now, we accept the approach and instruct it to proceed. The next step in the workflow is the generation of pull requests.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Generating pull requests</h2>
			<p>Once Q receives <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>our marching orders to proceed with the approved approach, it will generate the necessary code and create a pull request. At this step, the workflow moves to the review stage. Developers will once again appreciate how much time this is going to save them.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows Amazon Q doing all the work of branching and creating the necessary changes and presenting all this in a pull request for the approver to review.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.13 – Amazon Q completed the approach and generated a pull request" src="img/B21378_16_13.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.13 – Amazon Q completed the approach and generated a pull request</p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>you click on the pull request, the approach is laid out in the overview, making it easy for the reviewer to understand the changes that were made in the code base. The following screenshot shows the overview page of the pull request, which summarizes the changes.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.14 – Amazon Q-generated pull request overview in CodeCatalyst" src="img/B21378_16_14.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.14 – Amazon Q-generated pull request overview in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>generation of a pull request, along with a detailed description of the changes, really helps with the next step of the workflow, which is to review and revise the suggested changes in the code base.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Reviewing and revising code changes</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>approver <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>would typically want to compare the proposed changes on a side-by-side comparison screen so that it’s easy to understand all the changes in different code files. The following screenshot shows a comparison screen highlighting all the changes proposed by Amazon Q in green.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.15 – Amazon Q-generated pull request code comparison in CodeCatalyst" src="img/B21378_16_15.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.15 – Amazon Q-generated pull request code comparison in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>Recall a <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>while back we mentioned that there seems to be an issue in one of the code snippets <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>suggested by the Amazon Q approach. Since we did not notice it during the previous step, it is prominent in the pull request when the actual code is presented for review. No team wants incorrect code to creep into the repository, hence it is usually a best practice to review and approve pull requests before the code is merged into the main branch.</p>
			<p>Upon closer inspection, it is observed that <code>compression</code> is not a direct property of the Glue table in the CDK code file. Therefore, the code <code>compression:glue.Compression.SNAPPY</code> will fail to compile during the build stage. Instead of doing this all over again, CodeCatalyst will allow the reviewer to add comments right inside the pull request screen and make a revision request.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, we added a comment next to the incorrect line of code, asking the system to use a different logic.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.16 – Add a comment in the pull request and request a revision in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>you hit the <strong class="bold">Create Revision</strong> button on the pull request screen, Amazon Q is invoked again. It <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>takes the comment made in the code as a prompt and creates a new revision of the pull request with the correct logic this time. This is highlighted in the following screenshot, where revision v2 was able to come back with the correct code.</p>

			<p>Once the reviewer confirms everything looks correct, they can approve the pull request in CodeCatalyst as the next step. This is highlighted in the following screenshot.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Merging code changes in the repository</h2>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>review and approval are done, the code can be merged into the main branch, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>

			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>merge request triggers the workflow to recompile, rebuild, and redeploy the code via the CI/CD process. You can always go to the workflows in the CI/CD section to confirm the successful completion of the build and deploy process. The following screenshot shows the successful build of the workflow after the pull request was merged.</p>

			<p>For our <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>Glue ETL use case, the workflow will compile the code and trigger the AWS CloudFormation stack via the CDK logic. The CloudFormation stack, in turn, will recreate/update the necessary infrastructure that was affected by the code changes. In our case, you can go to the Glue console and check the updated ETL job with the compression logic in it ready to be triggered for the next run.</p>
			<p>Before we wind down the feature development capability in CodeCatalyst using Amazon Q, I also want to provide an alternate scenario of failure. In the world of software engineering, not everything goes as planned. What if during the code review process, the reviewer did not catch the code issue and did not fix it using the revision feature? Well, they would have approved the request, and the merge process would have triggered the workflow, eventually resulting in failure.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the failed workflow if the code issue had not been revised during the pull request process.</p>

			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>next steps after this would be to create another issue in CodeCatalyst, provide the error details in the description, and assign it back to Amazon Q for analysis and troubleshooting. You may have to engage in prompt engineering and provide multiple comments along the way for Amazon Q to arrive at the correct logic that would fix the issue. Once you go through the entire process, the new code will again be included in the pull request for approval and merging into the main branch.</p>
			<p>Before we wind down this chapter, we will quickly look at a couple of other cool features in CodeCatalyst using Amazon Q that help developers save time and effort.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Amazon Q’s summarizing capability in Amazon CodeCatalyst</h1>
			<p>Developers <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>will understand the pain of trying to comprehend the changes made in a pull request submission. Typically, the people who make code changes are not the ones approving them. So, someone else needs to understand all the changes made in the code base, analyze their intended effect, and finally, approve them if they meet the standards.</p>
			<p>Without proper <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>comments, it’s difficult to understand all the nuances of the changes made. Sometimes, even with <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>comments, it gets overwhelming to grasp the full intention of the changes. This is where Amazon Q steps in to make life easier for developers and approvers.</p>
			<p>Let’s look at Amazon Q’s ability to analyze code changes and generate a summary of the changes when creating a pull request, as well as create a summary based on all the comments made on the code changes in a pull request.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Pull request comment summary</h2>
			<p>When reviewing a <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>pull request, users often leave numerous comments regarding the proposed changes. With multiple reviewers providing feedback, it can become challenging to identify common themes or ensure a thorough review of all comments across revisions. To streamline this process, the <strong class="bold">Create comment summary</strong> feature utilizes Amazon Q to analyze all comments left on code changes within a pull request and generate a concise summary of the feedback.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the summary generated by Amazon Q for the compression changes we did in our pull request.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Pull request description</h2>
			<p>Pull requests <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>serve as a collaborative platform for reviewing code alterations, whether they’re minor fixes, significant feature additions, or updates to released software versions. Including a summary of the code changes and their purpose in the pull request description aids reviewers in comprehending the alterations and fosters a historical perspective on the code evolution. However, developers frequently depend on the code itself to convey information, resulting in vague or insufficiently detailed descriptions that hinder reviewers’ understanding of the changes or their underlying intent.</p>
			<p>This is where the <strong class="bold">Write description for me</strong> feature comes in handy, as it is able to generate a description of the changes in the pull request, making it easier to review and approve changes. The following screen shows the <strong class="bold">Write description for me</strong> option on the pull request screen.</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.24 – Pull request description generation feature in CodeCatalyst</p>
			<p>Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>examines the disparities between the source branch containing the code modifications and the target branch where you intend to merge these alterations. Subsequently, it generates a summary outlining the nature of these modifications and offers its most accurate interpretation of their purpose and impact.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the description generated by Amazon Q using all the information from the pull request.</p>

			<p>CodeCatalyst is a <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>comprehensive service with numerous features of its own. We have only covered some of the next-generation features provided in the service via Amazon Q, which is a generative AI-powered assistant.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered some of the challenges faced by developers during the DevOps process. We then introduced Amazon CodeCatalyst, a comprehensive software development service designed for development teams to rapidly construct, deploy, and scale applications on AWS.</p>
			<p>After that, we leveraged a use case to demonstrate the different generative AI capabilities of the service. Amazon Q allows developers to rapidly add new features to software. Developers can create issues and assign them to Amazon Q for comprehensive understanding and recommendations for different approaches needed to solve the particular task provided as input. Q can also be prompted to provide revised approaches based on the comments that users provide. It then generates the code and creates a pull request so that reviewers can examine the proposed changes and either approve or request revisions before merging them back into the main repository.</p>
			<p>We also explored how Amazon Q provides pull request comment summaries and generates pull request descriptions. All these features boost developer productivity and save significant time during the entire software development process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Final thoughts</h1>
