			<p>While the main focus of this book is to teach you how to use n8n to build application workflows and connect various tools together, it is extremely important that your applications have a proper <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>). This is the primary way that people interact with your product and is the biggest aspect of the <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>).</p>
			<p>Having spent time learning about how the Bubble <strong class="bold">application programming interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>) works in the previous chapter, we have a good understanding of what happens with Bubble "under the hood." Now, we will be using Bubble to build a UI and a design model that will allow you to create your own UI.</p>
			<p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing responsive design for your web app</li>
				<li>Working with events in Bubble</li>
				<li>Validating data in Bubble</li>
				<li>Designing the application structure</li>
				<li>Dealing with errors in Bubble</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have completed this chapter, you will know how to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design responsive applications using the Bubble <strong class="bold">graphical UI</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>).</li>
				<li>Learn how the look and feel of an application can change the UX.</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Let's start this chapter by looking at responsive design and implementing it into your Bubble web application.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Implementing responsive design for your web app</h1>
			<p>Responsive design is a methodology for building web-based applications that display information <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>correctly, regardless of the device or <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>screen/window size. The ability to view information on various devices and screen sizes has become increasingly important over the last decade. The following screenshot reflects this trend: </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Desktop versus mobile usage over the last decade</p>
			<p>According to <em class="italic">StatCounter</em> (<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#monthly-201111-202111">https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#monthly-201111-202111</a>), 10 years ago, over 93% of people were accessing the internet using their computer. Today, that number has dropped to around 44%. More people have gone from large computer screens to smaller mobile devices to interact with web-based UIs. Because of this, it is critical that your web app looks <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>good and is easy to use, regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>of whether you are using it on your 30-inch computer monitor or your 4-inch phone screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Responsive design factors</h2>
			<p>For your application to <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>work responsively, here are some factors to consider when building your application.</p>
			<h3>Using the Responsive Viewer</h3>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Design</strong> tab of the <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>Bubble application interface, you find the <strong class="bold">Responsive</strong> tab located to the right of the <strong class="bold">UI Builder</strong> tab. The <strong class="bold">Responsive Viewer</strong> allows you to see what your page looks like on different-sized devices.</p>
			<h3>Minimum width</h3>
			<p>Increase the minimum width of elements to use more of the page margins. Larger minimum widths make your <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>design look better on smaller screens.</p>
			<h3>Fixed width</h3>
			<p>Some elements, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>icons, should have their width fixed. This prevents the elements from becoming too small or large as the screen size changes. </p>
			<h3>Maximum width</h3>
			<p>Buttons and inputs <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>may look strange if they are too large. Correct this issue by setting the control maximum width side.</p>
			<h3>Margins</h3>
			<p>Consistent margin size is <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>an integral part of the design aesthetic. Whenever possible, keep margin sizes consistent.</p>
			<h3>Collapsing margins</h3>
			<p>Remove the left <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>and right margins around specific elements (for example, graphics; embedded elements) when the screen size gets smaller. This more efficiently uses valuable screen real estate.</p>
			<h3>Alignment</h3>
			<p>Align elements to either the left or right margin so that it "sticks" to one side. This makes your <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>design more predictable as the screen size changes.</p>
			<h3>Hiding elements</h3>
			<p>When a parent element's (for example, a page) width drops below a specified size, do not show <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>the element. With smaller screens, this provides a much better experience for the user.</p>
			<h3>Wrapping to the previous line</h3>
			<p>If a page size becomes large enough to accommodate the element on the previous line, it moves it to <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>the previous line. This prevents large areas of white space along the right margin for larger screens.</p>
			<h3>Text element options</h3>
			<p>When working <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>with text elements, there are a couple of other options that should be considered, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>…</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shrink if text gets shorter</strong>—Reduces the height of a text element if there is white space.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Image/Google Map/shape element proportions</h3>
			<p>Use the <strong class="bold">Keep element proportions</strong> option <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>to maintain the width and height ratio regardless of screen size.</p>
			<h3>Repeating group cell width</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Current cell minimum width</strong> option allows you to "stack" cells differently rather than just <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>shrinking cells to a point where they become unreadable. You accomplish this by increasing the <strong class="bold">Current cell minimum width</strong> value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Using the Responsive Viewer</h2>
			<p>By default, the Responsive Viewer is in large-screen mode, which shows you how your page will look with <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>a screen that is 1,200 <strong class="bold">pixels</strong> (<strong class="bold">px</strong>) wide, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.02_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Responsive Viewer in large-screen mode&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – Responsive Viewer in large-screen mode</p>
			<p>You can change this view to see, for example, how the page will look when viewed from a mobile device such as a cell phone, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.03_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – Responsive Viewer viewed from a mobile&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – Responsive Viewer viewed from a mobile</p>
			<p>Throughout the design process when you are building your application, it is a good idea to come back <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>to the Responsive Viewer frequently to ensure that your application continues to look good, regardless of the device that is being used.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Learning more</h2>
			<p>This has just been an overview of responsive design and there is a lot more you can learn about Bubble and <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>how responsive design is implemented. If you wish to dig deeper into Bubble responsive design, see the <em class="italic">Building Responsive Pages</em> web page in the Bubble documentation (<a href="https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/building-a-user-interface/building-responsive-pages">https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/building-a-user-interface/building-responsive-pages</a>).</p>
			<p>Responsive pages are very important to the modern web application user and can make or break the usefulness of an application, but even the best responsive web application is completely useless if it is not designed to work with events properly. Fortunately, this is the next topic that we are covering!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Working with events in Bubble</h1>
			<p>An event is an action <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>that occurs within the Bubble app <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>to trigger workflows. Actions within the Bubble interface often trigger events, but systems can also trigger events outside of Bubble, such as n8n.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Event types</h2>
			<p>While there are a number of different types of events that exist in Bubble, most of them are designed to be <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>used internally with Bubble and do not interact with systems outside of the Bubble environment. These internal events are important to understand when working with Bubble and we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with them.</p>
			<h3>General events</h3>
			<p>These events are common <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>to most areas of Bubble and are <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>accessible accordingly. They are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">User Logged In</strong>—This event fires whenever a user logs in to your Bubble application.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User Logged Out</strong>—Actions associated with this event will be executed when the user logs out of the Bubble application.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Page Loaded</strong>—A <strong class="bold">page load</strong> occurs when a person opens up a web page on their computer. This event is fired whenever this happens.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Do Every X Seconds</strong>—It can be useful to perform an action repeatedly based on how much time has elapsed since the last time the event occurred. This event is filed every <em class="italic">X</em> seconds, where <em class="italic">X</em> represents the number of seconds between events.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When Condition True</strong>—This event compares some parameter of the system (for example, day of the week) with <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>a value (for example, Tuesday) and then <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>performs an action only if the comparison is true (for example, the action will only be executed if the day of the week is Tuesday).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Element events</h3>
			<p>Element events are related <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>to the actual UI itself and are designed to interact <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>with the user via the web UI. These events generally respond to something the user has done while in the application. They are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Element Clicked</strong>—This event is fired when a user clicks on a specific element in the web UI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Input Value Changed</strong>—If a field in a form has a value that is then changed by the user, this event fires.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map Marker Clicked</strong>—Map elements in Bubble can have markers placed on them. This event fires when the user clicks on one of these elements.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Popup Opened</strong>—Bubble enables you to display messages to the user in the form of popups. This event fires when one of these popups opens.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Popup Closed</strong>—You can also fire an event when the user closes the popup that was displayed to the user.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Trigger events</h3>
			<p>Trigger events are special events <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>in the Bubble system that occur when changes are made in the <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>database. These events can reference data values before a change in the database occurred or they can reference the values after a change in the database.</p>
			<p>A couple of things to remember about trigger events. First, these events run with full privileges and have access to all data in the system, not just the data of the user who triggered the event. Second, trigger <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>events can only trigger a single action, and that <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>action cannot be used to trigger other actions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Setting up events</h2>
			<p>In Bubble, events are managed in the <strong class="bold">Workflow</strong> editor tab. You configure actions that occur when a specific event is <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>fired from this page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.04_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – Event in Workflow editor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – Event in Workflow editor</p>
			<p>For example, <em class="italic">Figure 9.4</em> is displaying how an individual can run the <strong class="bold">n8n Workflows - Send n8n Data</strong> plugin action when a user logs in to the Bubble app.</p>
			<p>You can also run multiple actions when one event occurs, chaining the actions to execute one after <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>the other. This allows you to perform complex actions while still keeping individual actions simple. This process is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.05_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Chaining actions to an event&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Going deeper</h2>
			<p>This has just been a brief introduction to Bubble events, and you can dig a lot deeper into this topic. If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>looking to get a stronger <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>understanding of events within the Bubble environment, I would suggest you start with <em class="italic">Building Workflows</em> (<a href="https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/building-workflows">https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/building-workflows</a>) and <em class="italic">Events</em> (<a href="https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/events">https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/events</a>) from the Bubble documentation.</p>
			<p>Events are an important aspect of the Bubble architecture and are a critical part of proper data manipulation. But, if the data being entered into your Bubble app is faulty or the system confuses the different types of data, then suddenly the app becomes useless.</p>
			<p>The next section helps to avoid some of these issues by showing us how to validate that the data being entered or analyzed is the correct data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Validating data in Bubble</h1>
			<p>At the core of many applications is data. These applications rely on consistent, accurate, and structured <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>data to provide analysis and insightful information. They also <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>use the data to control different aspects of the application itself.</p>
			<p>For these reasons, it is important that the data you are gathering and saving is as accurate as possible, especially when gathering that data from users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Field types</h2>
			<p>The first way to control your data is through field types. Field types describe the data that can be entered <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>into a specific field and restrict the information that can be entered into that field to that type of data. If you have a database background, these can be equated to data types within a database.</p>
			<p>There are nine built-in field types in Bubble, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Text</strong>—Any type of <strong class="bold">American Standard Code for Information Interchange</strong> (<strong class="bold">ASCII</strong>)-based <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>text. Similar <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>to a <strong class="bold">variable character field</strong> (<strong class="bold">VARCHAR</strong>). </li>
				<li><code>FLOAT</code> or <code>DECIMAL</code>, but without the precision requirements.</li>
				<li><code>CHECK</code> range to an <code>INT</code> field value.</li>
				<li><code>DATETIME</code> data type.</li>
				<li><code>CHECK</code> range for a <code>DATETIME</code> data type column.</li>
				<li><code>TRUE</code>) or <code>FALSE</code>). Similar to a <code>BOOLEAN</code> data type in a database. There is no <code>NULL</code> value for this field, as an empty field translates to a <code>FALSE</code>) value.</li>
				<li><code>VARCHAR</code> value that references the location of a file in a filesystem.</li>
				<li><code>VARCHAR</code> value that references the location of a file in a filesystem.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Geographic address</strong>—This is a unique field type that stores geographic information as text that has been validated by the Google Maps API. It appears as a street address, much like what you would find when mailing a letter.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Custom data types</h2>
			<p>You can also create custom data types. These are typically groups of field or other custom data types that <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>work together. For example, a <strong class="bold">meeting</strong> type might be made up of a <strong class="bold">date</strong>, a <strong class="bold">location</strong>, and a <strong class="bold">subject</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Using the fields</h2>
			<p>Once you have field and data types defined, this can control the type of data that is required for data input. Depending on the type of data that is being stored in the database, you will have <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>different options available to you for restricting the type of data that is acceptable to the field, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.06_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Date &amp; Time field restrictions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Date &amp; Time field restrictions</p>
			<p>For example, <em class="italic">Figure 9.6</em> shows some of the restrictions that are available in the <strong class="bold">Date &amp; Time</strong> input type. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>control the minimum and maximum values for the date and hour and require that the field not be empty.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>More data validation</h2>
			<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to data validation. There can be some very complex rules <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>around the type of data that is permittable for an application, and it is worth your time to truly understand what these data rules should be and how to ensure your application is following those rules.</p>
			<p>To get a deeper understanding of how to better manage your applications' data, I would suggest starting <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>with <em class="italic">Working with Data</em> in the Bubble documentation (<a href="https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data">https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data</a>) and use what you learn to maintain your data's integrity.</p>
			<p>Now that we know we have the right types of data in the system, it is important that this data moves <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>throughout the application properly and is stored predictably in the right places. Just like driving your car down the main hallway of your home and parking it in the living room, a poorly designed application structure can lead to unpredictable (and often disastrous) results. The next section covers how to plan and build the application structure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Designing the application structure</h1>
			<p>An application does not just come out of thin air. A lot of planning and thinking goes into properly <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>structuring an application so that it is both simple and useful. Some factors to consider when designing the application structure include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How many activities will the user need to perform?</li>
				<li>What type of data will be gathered?</li>
				<li>Does the user require authentication?</li>
				<li>Is the UX simple and logical?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is extremely important that you think about how these (and other) factors affect your application and how your users interact with it. This helps to make your application easy to manage and maintain.</p>
			<p>One of the first tasks that you should complete, even before you start coding a single page, is to create a flowchart that shows how a user moves through the application for each action that they will perform. This should show not only how the user interacts with the application but also how both the user and the application interact with the data in the application.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot demonstrates such a workflow. This shows which data is being displayed/the user for each page, along with the path that the user must follow to get to each page:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.07_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – Simple application workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – Simple application workflow</p>
			<p>This is an extremely valuable asset to have, especially if your team is large and different people are developing <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>different parts of the application separately. It ensures that everyone understands how the application will work and how data will be managed.</p>
			<p>It is also useful to ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>that the scope of the application does not change or expand. It makes it very clear what should and should not be designed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Reviewing the design</h2>
			<p>Once you have completed <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>the overall design, it is well worth having someone else on your team (or review it yourself if you are a team of one) to ensure that the design meets the goals and requirements of the application.</p>
			<p>One excellent way is to create user stories that describe an activity from the perspective of the user. These stories are often in the form of <em class="italic">As a &lt;user type&gt;, I want to &lt;goal to accomplish&gt; so that &lt;reason for activity&gt;</em>.</p>
			<p>For example, you may have the following user story:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">As an author, I want to be able to edit newsletters that have already been published so that I can update information that may no longer be valid.</em></p>
			<p>You can now take this user story and see whether there is a path in your workflow that will enable this to happen. If it turns out that there is no way for this to happen (which is the case for our diagram in <em class="italic">Figure 9.7</em>), you may need to go back and update your application design.</p>
			<p>Once you are satisfied with the design of your application, ensure that it is marked as a final design and share it with your development team so that everyone is using the same design and aiming for the same goal.</p>
			<p>But even with a really good design, things can still go wrong. This is where error handling and troubleshooting come into play.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Dealing with errors in Bubble</h1>
			<p>Applications are inherently complicated systems. There are events occurring behind the scenes, users behaving <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>in unexpected ways, and unexpected <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>platform upgrades that break previously usable code. Sometimes, it's a wonder that any applications work at all.</p>
			<p>Because of this complexity, it is critical that applications be designed to anticipate ways that users can misuse the system while also dealing with errors that occur despite the best efforts of the application designers and developers.</p>
			<p>Bubble has several <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>tools available to help deal with errors that can crop up <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>in the application, and several best practices will assist you if something goes wrong and you need to get things working correctly again.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Planning for user error</h2>
			<p>It is not uncommon for users to be a significant source of errors in your application. Either by simply not understanding what your application is attempting to accomplish or by maliciously attempting <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>to bypass security and restrictions put in place, users can and will break your application. But you can minimize the impact that users have on your application by following a few best practices.</p>
			<p>One of the best ways is to think like a user. Have someone test the application who is just a standard user and knows nothing about how your application works prior to rolling it out to the rest of the world. Carefully document how the user got themselves into the situation where they generated errors and how the error was handled. Then, update the workflow, deal with the error, and test again.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Locking down the application</h2>
			<p>There are a lot of different areas within the application that can cause problems if the user is allowed <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>into them. For example, if the user can get into the user management portion of the system, they can add or delete users at random, causing all types of chaos.</p>
			<p>Because of this, it is critical that the application be locked down to prevent random users from accessing parts of the application that they should not be able to access. This not only applies to the application itself but also to any management consoles, admin panels, and data management portals.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Detailed logging</h2>
			<p>If an error does occur, it is important <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>that you have a way of determining what led up to the error. Building in a detailed logging service will allow you to trace what happened before the error occurred so that you can troubleshoot the problem and hopefully resolve what caused it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Debugging tools</h2>
			<p>Bubble has two <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>excellent tools that will help you to resolve problems that come up while developing your application.</p>
			<p>The first tool is the <strong class="bold">Issue Checker</strong>. This appears as a red warning icon with red text, indicating the number of issues that exist in your application.</p>
			<p>You can get more information about issues by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Issue Checker</strong>. This will pop up a list of all the issues. Clicking on any one of the items in the issue list will open up the screen where the issue exists.</p>
			<p>The second debugging tool is the <strong class="bold">Debugger</strong>. The Debugger allows you to walk through your application step by step and see issues happening behind the scenes that the application user does not see.</p>
			<p>To initiate the Debugger, simply open up any page of your application and then add <code>&amp;debug_mode=true</code> at the end of the <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>). This will reopen your <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>application page with the <strong class="bold">Debugger</strong> toolbar at the bottom, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.08_B17493.jpg" alt="Figure 9.8 – Application with Debugger toolbar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Application with Debugger toolbar</p>
			<p>This allows you to get a <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>lot more detail about what the application is doing and provides you with clues for how issues may be corrected.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Designing and building a suitable web-based UI is one of the most critical aspects of your application build. It is the primary way that your users interact with you and your brand, and it is the ambassador for your organization. Thus, it is critical that it is as user-friendly, easily accessible, simple to understand, and error-free as possible. Hopefully, after having now completed this chapter, you are confident in the steps that you need to take in order to build this UI.</p>
			<p>But what happens when you have your UI completed, all the workflows have been optimized, and the application still does not do what you need it to do? How do you extend the capabilities beyond what the Bubble development environment will allow you to do?</p>
			<p>This is where n8n plays a major role in expanding these capabilities. We will be covering how to do exactly that in the next chapter.</p>
