			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at some of the categories of programming languages. We then discussed an overview of foundational programming languages before focusing on two dominant ones used in the software industry: C and C++. We introduced how auto-code generation, especially using Amazon Q Developer, is integrated and can be used by C and C++ developers to understand, learn the syntax, and automatically <span class="No-Break">generate code.</span></p>
			<p>Similar to the previous chapter, in this chapter, we will focus on two programming languages. We will start with an overview of web programming languages and then focus on two that are commonly used in the software industry: <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong class="bold">JS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">PHP</strong>. We will introduce how auto-code generation, particularly through Amazon Q Developer, can be used by JS and PHP developers for understanding the basics, learning the syntax, automatically generating code, code explainability, and optimization through <span class="No-Break">code recommendations.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Overview of web development programming languages</h1>
			<p>In earlier chapters, we <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>reviewed different programming language categories and delved deep into foundational languages such as C and C++, which power many system constructs. Now, let’s dive into web development languages such as <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>JS and PHP, which enable dynamic and interactive web experiences. These are some <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>of the most popular languages for<a id="_idIndexMarker279"/> server-side scripting, client-side scripting, <strong class="bold">Document Object Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">DOM</strong>) programming, web APIs, mobile applications, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>A few decades ago, with the growth in web application development, many languages were introduced in the software industry. Web development languages play a crucial role in shaping the interactive and functional aspects of modern web applications. Among these, JS and PHP are prominent for their respective roles in client-side and server-side scripting. JS powers dynamic and interactive user experiences in web browsers, while PHP facilitates server-side logic for dynamic content generation and database interactions. In the realm of web development, efficiency and productivity are key factors for success. Developers often face challenges such as repetitive coding tasks, maintaining code consistency across different modules, and keeping up with evolving best practices. Auto-code generation has emerged as a solution to these challenges, enabling developers to automate routine coding tasks and streamline <span class="No-Break">their workflow.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer, an <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>advanced tool leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, offers significant capabilities in auto-code generation for JavaScript and PHP. By integrating Amazon Q Developer into the development process, developers can leverage its features to enhance productivity, improve code quality, and expedite the <span class="No-Break">development cycle.</span></p>
			<p>JS, as a frontend scripting language, is instrumental in creating interactive user interfaces and dynamic web content. However, JS development can become complex due to the need for cross-browser compatibility, asynchronous programming patterns, and managing event-driven interactions. Amazon Q Developer simplifies JS development by generating code snippets and functions tailored to specific requirements instructed in the prompts. Web developers can leverage different prompting techniques and chat style integrations (refer to <a href="B21378_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>) to get recommendations for the automated creation of event handlers, DOM manipulation functions, and asynchronous operations, thereby reducing development time and ensuring code consistency across different <span class="No-Break">browser environments.</span></p>
			<p>On the<a id="_idIndexMarker281"/> server side, PHP<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> remains a popular choice for dynamic web applications and backend services. PHP’s versatility in handling form submissions, session management, and database interactions makes it indispensable for web developers. However, writing efficient and secure PHP code requires adherence to coding standards and best practices. Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> assists developers by generating optimized PHP code snippets for common tasks such as database queries, form processing, and error handling. This not only accelerates development but also enhances code reliability <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, Amazon Q Developer supports the learning and understanding of <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>JS and PHP syntax. For developers new to these languages, Amazon Q Developer provides interactive tutorials and code examples through chat-style interactions. Developers can use prompts to request explanations of language features, obtain code snippets for specific functionalities, or generate complete scripts based on predefined templates. This educational aspect of Amazon Q Developer helps shorten the learning curve and empowers developers to quickly grasp essential concepts <span class="No-Break">and techniques.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help a web programmer. To illustrate, I am using the Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> for the configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code and check the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter for the URLs for JS and PHP in <span class="No-Break">VS Code)</span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs, which, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers/code blocks shown in the code snapshots; try to update prompts to get the desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer/code should meet <span class="No-Break">the requirements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>JS auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, let’s explore how Amazon Q Developer can assist a new web programmer planning to work with JS but lacking a background in the language. We will use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate <span class="No-Break">the programmer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>JS language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s learn about the<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> JS programming language by asking<a id="_idIndexMarker286"/> about the very basics <span class="No-Break">of JS:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3 – Chat style – JS DOM manipulation</p>
			<p>As shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> preceding partial screenshot, Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>Q Developer begins with the basics of DOM manipulation, which refers to the ability to dynamically access and modify the content, structure, and style of a web page using JS. The DOM represents the hierarchical structure of an HTML document, where each element, attribute, and text node is an object that can be accessed and manipulated. It then continues by providing specific details related to categories such as accessing DOM elements, creating and modifying elements, manipulating attributes, handling events, modifying styles, and DOM manipulation libraries and frameworks. At the end, it provides a summary highlighting the importance of JS for DOM manipulation: “<strong class="bold">DOM manipulation is a crucial aspect of building dynamic and interactive web applications. By leveraging JavaScript’s capabilities to access and modify the DOM, developers can create rich user experiences, update content on-the-fly, validate user input, and respond to user interactions without requiring a full-page refresh</strong>”, with reference <span class="No-Break">sources included.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s ask Amazon Q Developer for the syntax of one of the most useful loops used while coding complex scripts, the <strong class="source-inline">for...in</strong> loop <span class="No-Break">in JS:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Provide syntax and example of "for…in loop" in JS</pre>			<div>

			<p>Observe in the <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>preceding screenshot that <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>Amazon Q Developer provided the syntax, details, and an example of a <strong class="source-inline">for...in</strong> loop. Now, let’s move to the sample use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>End-to-end JS use case development</h2>
			<p>To illustrate, I am<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> going to use the VS Code<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> script editor window with single and <span class="No-Break">multi-line prompts.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the use case: Create JS end-to-end code to build a to-do list application. Create tasks such as adding new items, marking items as completed, and deleting items. Use JS to manipulate the DOM and respond to user events. Here is <span class="No-Break">the prompt:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

The end-to-end code meets the specifics of your prompts, showcasing Amazon Q Developer’s capability to generate comprehensive and functional code for web <span class="No-Break">development tasks.</span></p>
			<p>In the current version of the code, Amazon Q Developer added two buttons: <strong class="source-inline">Delete</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Complete</strong>. If we use the basic chain of thought for actions supported by the application, it appears that a <strong class="source-inline">Cancel</strong> button is missing. Let’s use a single-line prompt technique to suggest to Amazon Q Developer to add a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Cancel</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> button:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer added multiple lines of code to add the <strong class="source-inline">Cancel</strong> button. It effectively used JS functions such as <strong class="source-inline">document.createElement</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">cancelButton.onclick</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"> taskList.removeChild</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, let’s see how Amazon Q Developer supports <span class="No-Break">PHP developers.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>PHP auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Just like previously, first, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>assume that a new web programmer is planning to work with <strong class="bold">PHP</strong> (which is a recursive acronym for <strong class="bold">PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</strong>) and does not have much experience coding with a PHP background. Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate <span class="No-Break">the programmer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>PHP language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>learn about<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> the PHP <span class="No-Break">programming language:</span></p>
