			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Boost Coding Efficiency for JavaScript and PHP with Auto-Code Generation</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following key topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overview of web development programming languages</li>
				<li>JavaScript auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>PHP auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</li>
				<li>JavaScript and PHP code explainability and optimization using Amazon Q Developer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at some of the categories of programming languages. We then discussed an overview of foundational programming languages before focusing on two dominant ones used in the software industry: C and C++. We introduced how auto-code generation, especially using Amazon Q Developer, is integrated and can be used by C and C++ developers to understand, learn the syntax, and automatically generate code.</p>
			<p>Similar to the previous chapter, in this chapter, we will focus on two programming languages. We will start with an overview of web programming languages and then focus on two that are commonly used in the software industry: <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong class="bold">JS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">PHP</strong>. We will introduce how auto-code generation, particularly through Amazon Q Developer, can be used by JS and PHP developers for understanding the basics, learning the syntax, automatically generating code, code explainability, and optimization through code recommendations.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Overview of web development programming languages</h1>
			<p>In earlier chapters, we <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>reviewed different programming language categories and delved deep into foundational languages such as C and C++, which power many system constructs. Now, let’s dive into web development languages such as <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>JS and PHP, which enable dynamic and interactive web experiences. These are some <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>of the most popular languages for<a id="_idIndexMarker279"/> server-side scripting, client-side scripting, <strong class="bold">Document Object Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">DOM</strong>) programming, web APIs, mobile applications, and more.</p>
			<p>A few decades ago, with the growth in web application development, many languages were introduced in the software industry. Web development languages play a crucial role in shaping the interactive and functional aspects of modern web applications. Among these, JS and PHP are prominent for their respective roles in client-side and server-side scripting. JS powers dynamic and interactive user experiences in web browsers, while PHP facilitates server-side logic for dynamic content generation and database interactions. In the realm of web development, efficiency and productivity are key factors for success. Developers often face challenges such as repetitive coding tasks, maintaining code consistency across different modules, and keeping up with evolving best practices. Auto-code generation has emerged as a solution to these challenges, enabling developers to automate routine coding tasks and streamline their workflow.</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer, an <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>advanced tool leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, offers significant capabilities in auto-code generation for JavaScript and PHP. By integrating Amazon Q Developer into the development process, developers can leverage its features to enhance productivity, improve code quality, and expedite the development cycle.</p>
			<p>JS, as a frontend scripting language, is instrumental in creating interactive user interfaces and dynamic web content. However, JS development can become complex due to the need for cross-browser compatibility, asynchronous programming patterns, and managing event-driven interactions. Amazon Q Developer simplifies JS development by generating code snippets and functions tailored to specific requirements instructed in the prompts. Web developers can leverage different prompting techniques and chat style integrations (refer to <a href="B21378_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>) to get recommendations for the automated creation of event handlers, DOM manipulation functions, and asynchronous operations, thereby reducing development time and ensuring code consistency across different browser environments.</p>
			<p>On the<a id="_idIndexMarker281"/> server side, PHP<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> remains a popular choice for dynamic web applications and backend services. PHP’s versatility in handling form submissions, session management, and database interactions makes it indispensable for web developers. However, writing efficient and secure PHP code requires adherence to coding standards and best practices. Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> assists developers by generating optimized PHP code snippets for common tasks such as database queries, form processing, and error handling. This not only accelerates development but also enhances code reliability and security.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Amazon Q Developer supports the learning and understanding of <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>JS and PHP syntax. For developers new to these languages, Amazon Q Developer provides interactive tutorials and code examples through chat-style interactions. Developers can use prompts to request explanations of language features, obtain code snippets for specific functionalities, or generate complete scripts based on predefined templates. This educational aspect of Amazon Q Developer helps shorten the learning curve and empowers developers to quickly grasp essential concepts and techniques.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s dive deep to see how Amazon Q Developer can help a web programmer. To illustrate, I am using the Amazon Q Developer interface with VS Code (refer to <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> for the configuration steps for Amazon Q Developer with VS Code and check the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter for the URLs for JS and PHP in VS Code).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs, which, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same answers/code blocks shown in the code snapshots; try to update prompts to get the desired recommendations. However, logically, the generated answer/code should meet the requirements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>JS auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>First, let’s explore how Amazon Q Developer can assist a new web programmer planning to work with JS but lacking a background in the language. We will use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate the programmer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>JS language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s learn about the<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> JS programming language by asking<a id="_idIndexMarker286"/> about the very basics of JS:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is programming language JavaScript(JS) and what are use cases best suitable for JS ?</pre>			<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided historical information about the original developers. It then summarized the common use cases by categorizing where the JS language excels. Additionally, it offered sources for further reference and learning.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.1 – Chat style – JS basics" src="img/B21378_06_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1 – Chat style – JS basics</p>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> observe that, in addition to <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>web development, Amazon Q Developer pointed out the versatility of JS applications, such as game development, desktop <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>applications, <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) applications, and machine learning applications. Amazon Q also provided guidelines about JS use in “<strong class="bold">applications that require a high degree of interactivity, responsiveness, and </strong><strong class="bold">dynamic behavior</strong>”<em class="italic">.</em></p>
			<p>Based on the preceding information, you can see that JS is so versatile and can be used in various software development projects across industries. Let’s look at the commonly used commands by JS web programmers:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What are the common commands in programming language JS?</pre>			<p>We will not be<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> going through each command, but <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>just for illustration, as you can see in the following partial screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided several categories of the common commands and constructs in the JS programming language. To make it easy to follow, it also included some of the common key commands for each of the categories.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.2 – Chat style – JS commands" src="img/B21378_06_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2 – Chat style – JS commands</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer highlighted multiple areas where JS has various supported command sets such as console commands, DOM manipulation commands, array manipulation, and more.</p>
			<p>Let’s use one of the areas to get information and ask Amazon Q Developer to provide details and examples related to JS support for DOM manipulation:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is DOM Manipulation and how JS supports it ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.3 – Chat style – JS DOM manipulation" src="img/B21378_06_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3 – Chat style – JS DOM manipulation</p>
			<p>As shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> preceding partial screenshot, Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>Q Developer begins with the basics of DOM manipulation, which refers to the ability to dynamically access and modify the content, structure, and style of a web page using JS. The DOM represents the hierarchical structure of an HTML document, where each element, attribute, and text node is an object that can be accessed and manipulated. It then continues by providing specific details related to categories such as accessing DOM elements, creating and modifying elements, manipulating attributes, handling events, modifying styles, and DOM manipulation libraries and frameworks. At the end, it provides a summary highlighting the importance of JS for DOM manipulation: “<strong class="bold">DOM manipulation is a crucial aspect of building dynamic and interactive web applications. By leveraging JavaScript’s capabilities to access and modify the DOM, developers can create rich user experiences, update content on-the-fly, validate user input, and respond to user interactions without requiring a full-page refresh</strong>”, with reference sources included.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s ask Amazon Q Developer for the syntax of one of the most useful loops used while coding complex scripts, the <code>for...in</code> loop in JS:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Provide syntax and example of "for…in loop" in JS</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.4 – Chat style – JS “for…in” loop example" src="img/B21378_06_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.4 – Chat style – JS “for…in” loop example</p>
			<p>Observe in the <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>preceding screenshot that <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>Amazon Q Developer provided the syntax, details, and an example of a <code>for...in</code> loop. Now, let’s move to the sample use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend the code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>End-to-end JS use case development</h2>
			<p>To illustrate, I am<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> going to use the VS Code<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> script editor window with single and multi-line prompts.</p>
			<p>Here is the use case: Create JS end-to-end code to build a to-do list application. Create tasks such as adding new items, marking items as completed, and deleting items. Use JS to manipulate the DOM and respond to user events. Here is the prompt:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* Create JS end to end code to building a to-do list application. Tasks to adding new items, mark items as completed, and delete items. Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and responding to user events. */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.5 – Prompt – JS program partial snapshot" src="img/B21378_06_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.5 – Prompt – JS program partial snapshot</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot shows a partial code snippet suggested by Amazon Q Developer. The full end-to-end code generated in response to our prompt demonstrates several fundamental and advanced concepts in JS and DOM manipulation. It effectively utilizes key JS functionalities related to the DOM, such as getting elements, creating elements, modifying elements, handling events, and applying styles. It leverages multiple key out-of-box functions of JS, including <code>document.getElementById</code>, <code>document.createElement</code>, <code>taskItem.appendChild</code>, <code>taskList.removeChild</code>, <code>Button.onclick</code>, and more. It also included a custom <code>addTask()</code> function to support coding best practices. The end-to-end code meets the specifics of your prompts, showcasing Amazon Q Developer’s capability to generate comprehensive and functional code for web development tasks.</p>
			<p>In the current version of the code, Amazon Q Developer added two buttons: <code>Delete</code> and <code>Complete</code>. If we use the basic chain of thought for actions supported by the application, it appears that a <code>Cancel</code> button is missing. Let’s use a single-line prompt technique to suggest to Amazon Q Developer to add a <code>Cancel</code> button:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* add Cancel button */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.6 – Prompt – JS program Cancel button" src="img/B21378_06_6.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6 – Prompt – JS program Cancel button</p>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer added multiple lines of code to add the <code>Cancel</code> button. It effectively used JS functions such as <code>document.createElement</code>, <code>cancelButton.onclick</code>, and<code> taskList.removeChild</code>.</p>
			<p>In the next section, let’s see how Amazon Q Developer supports PHP developers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>PHP auto-code generation using Amazon Q Developer</h1>
			<p>Just like previously, first, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>assume that a new web programmer is planning to work with <strong class="bold">PHP</strong> (which is a recursive acronym for <strong class="bold">PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</strong>) and does not have much experience coding with a PHP background. Let’s use Amazon Q Developer’s chat-style interface to educate the programmer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>PHP language basics</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>learn about<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> the PHP programming language:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What is programming language PHP and what are use cases best suitable for PHP ?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.7 – Chat style – PHP basics" src="img/B21378_06_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.7 – Chat style – PHP basics</p>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>can see in the preceding screenshot, Amazon<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> Q Developer provided basic information, such as informing us that PHP is a popular, open source, server-side scripting language widely used for web development. It is designed primarily for creating dynamic web pages and web applications. PHP’s versatility and the availability of numerous libraries and frameworks have expanded its use cases beyond the web.

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8 – Chat style – PHP server-side scripting support</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer began with the basics of server-side scripting, explaining that “<strong class="bold">Server-side scripting refers to the process of executing code on the server before sending the resulting output (typically HTML) to the client’s web browser</strong>”<em class="italic">.</em> It then provided context for PHP, highlighting that PHP is a server-side scripting language designed to run on the server and generate dynamic web pages. Additionally, it listed key functionality supported by PHP, such as embedding PHP code in HTML, processing user input, filesystem operations, database integration, session management, web services and APIs, and server configuration and environment.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> ask for some commonly used commands by PHP <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>web programmers:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: What are the common commands in programming language PHP?</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.9 – Chat style – PHP common commands partial screenshot" src="img/B21378_06_9.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9 – Chat style – PHP common commands partial screenshot</p>
			<p>We won’t cover every command, but as illustrated in the preceding partial screenshot, Amazon Q Developer provided various command categories such as output commands, variable commands, conditional statements, database commands, form commands, error handling, array commands, and more. To make it easier to follow, it included some common key commands for each category and provided references for users to obtain further detailed information on these topics.</p>
			<p>Database<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> commands is one of the important categories<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> that make PHP useful for server-side scripting. Now, let’s ask Amazon Q Developer for the syntax and an example of <code>mysqli_connect()</code> in PHP:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Q: Provide syntax and example of mysqli_connect() in PHP</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.10 – Chat style –PHP mysqli_connect()" src="img/B21378_06_10_new.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10 – Chat style –PHP mysqli_connect()</p>
			<p>As shown in <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>the preceding screenshot, Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>Developer provided an example for <code>mysqli_connect()</code> and explained the details of each line of the code to make it easier to understand.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>End-to-end PHP language use case development</h2>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>the sample <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>use case to show the power of Amazon Q Developer’s ability to recommend the code. To illustrate, I am going to use the same chat-style interface to generate the code and then move to the VS Code script editor window.</p>
			<p>A common use case for PHP in server-side programming is handling user authentication and managing sessions. This involves verifying user credentials, starting sessions, and managing session data to maintain user state across different pages of a web application. Here is the prompt:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* Write PHP server-side end to end programming to handle user authentication and managing sessions. This involves verifying user credentials, starting sessions, and managing session data to maintain user state across different pages of a web application. */</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.11 – Prompt – PHP program partial snapshot" src="img/B21378_06_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11 – Prompt – PHP program partial snapshot</p>
			<p>The preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker314"/> screenshot displays a partial code snippet suggested by Amazon Q Developer. You can use <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>the <code>authenticate ($username, $password)</code> function with error handling, and checks for valid users with session handling using <code>isset($_SESSION['loggedin']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['loggedin']</code>. The code meets the specifics of your prompts, demonstrating Amazon Q Developer’s ability to generate comprehensive and functional code for handling user authentication and managing sessions.</p>
			<p>The script is already echoing the error message, but let’s spice things up with some customization. Instead of just a boring error message, let’s display a random error image from a folder full of random images every time an error occurs. Let’s use the single-line prompt technique, to add a custom twist:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
/* show random error image from folder '/user/error/images/'*/</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.12 – Prompt – PHP program custom error image" src="img/B21378_06_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12 – Prompt – PHP program custom error image</p>
			<p>As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>see in the<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> preceding screenshot, Amazon Q Developer added multiple lines of code to randomly pick one image from our <code>error/images</code> directory and added it as part of the display.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s explore how Amazon Q Developer supports code explainability and optimization for JS and PHP.</p>
