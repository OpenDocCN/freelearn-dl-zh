			</ul>
			<p>At this time, it’s no secret that organizations are moving their IT infrastructure to the cloud at a rapid pace, with AWS being a market leader in offering cloud computing services for building their technology stack. When transitioning existing applications to AWS or creating new ones natively using many of the AWS services, there are certain steps that all builders need to take. A builder is a key persona in every organization, and those who leverage AWS services for their IT needs utilize AWS builders to address their business use cases.</p>
			<p>An AWS builder is an individual who uses AWS to design, develop, deploy, and manage applications and solutions on the AWS cloud platform. These individuals may be developers, engineers, architects, data scientists, or other professionals working with AWS services to build innovative and scalable solutions for their organizations or clients. AWS builders leverage the wide array of tools and services provided by AWS to create robust and efficient applications that meet the specific needs and requirements of their projects. They are responsible for understanding AWS services, implementing best practices, and continuously improving their skills to drive innovation and success in their projects.</p>
			<p>There is no denying that cloud computing has accelerated the IT build process compared to the on-premises world. However, large and complex projects still require significant time and effort before they can be brought into the production environment.</p>
			<p>Let’s quickly look at some of the key steps builders need to take to build projects on AWS.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Key steps for building solutions on AWS</h1>
			<p>The process builders <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>typically go through to solve a use case using AWS services involves several steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Understanding requirements</strong>: Builders first need to understand the requirements of the use case, including the problem to be solved, desired outcomes, and any constraints or limitations.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Selection of AWS services</strong>: Based on the requirements, builders select the appropriate AWS services that best fit the use case. This may involve researching and evaluating various AWS services to determine which ones provide the required features and capabilities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Designing the solution architecture</strong>: Builders design the architecture of the solution, including the overall system design, data flow, integration points, and scalability considerations. This involves creating diagrams, such as architecture diagrams or data flow diagrams, to visualize the solution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Setting up AWS resources</strong>: Builders provision and configure the necessary AWS resources to implement the solution. This may include setting up compute instances (e.g., EC2), storage (e.g., S3), databases (e.g., RDS), networking (e.g., VPC), and other services as required.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Developing application code</strong>: Builders develop the application code or scripts needed to implement the solution. This may involve writing code in programming languages such as Python, Java, or Node.js, as well as creating configuration files or scripts<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> for <strong class="bold">infrastructure as code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) tools such as AWS CloudFormation <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>or AWS <strong class="bold">Cloud Development </strong><strong class="bold">Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDK</strong>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Testing and debugging</strong>: Builders test the solution to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to validate the functionality and performance of the solution. Builders also debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployment and rollout</strong>: Once testing is complete, builders deploy the solution to<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> the production environment. This may involve deploying application code to compute instances, configuring load balancers and auto-scaling groups, and configuring DNS settings. Builders carefully plan and execute the deployment to minimize downtime and disruptions to users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring and optimization</strong>: After deployment, builders monitor the solution to ensure that it continues to operate smoothly and meets performance objectives. This involves monitoring metrics, logs, and alarms using AWS CloudWatch and other monitoring tools. Builders also optimize the solution for cost, performance, and scalability as needed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Documentation and knowledge sharing</strong>: Builders document the solution architecture, configuration, and deployment process to facilitate knowledge sharing and future maintenance. This documentation helps other team members understand how the solution works and how to troubleshoot issues if they arise.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, there are many steps involved in building a solution for a given use case using many of the AWS purpose-built services. Each step presents its own challenges, and every builder has their own approach to navigating through them. The key point here is that, often, building complex solutions takes time, with much of it devoted to research. This research may involve looking into similar use cases solved previously, weighing the pros and cons of specific AWS services, exploring design patterns and their implementation, and likely troubleshooting issues and errors encountered during the build process.</p>
			<p>Let’s dive right into how you can accelerate the process of building solutions on AWS using Amazon Q, which focuses on the area where builders often spend a significant amount of time – research.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Use case for leveraging Amazon Q features during the build process on AWS</h1>
			<p>To better understand<a id="_idIndexMarker664"/> how Amazon Q can help accelerate the build process on AWS, we will introduce a use case and then go through the steps of solving it. Along the way, we will highlight the many features of Amazon Q that can reduce the time a builder would otherwise spend.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind that, for simplicity, we are presenting a straightforward use case that can be solved in many different ways. However, once you go through the flow of the use case, it will help you understand the various features of Amazon Q when it comes to building solutions using AWS services. These features can be applied to any other complex use case an AWS builder might encounter in their organization. The key takeaway is to understand how these features save time and improve productivity, ultimately enhancing the experiences of AWS builders. Repeat after me – no AWS builder should be unhappy. Let’s jump straight into the use case.</p>
			<p>A company wants to build a web application where users can upload images for various purposes, such as profile pictures, product images, or content illustrations. To ensure optimal performance and user experience, the company aims to implement a scalable and efficient image processing pipeline to resize and optimize these images before storing them in the backend storage system.</p>
			<p>Since AWS is their preferred cloud services provider, the business wants the IT team to create a simple and cost-effective solution in a short time using AWS services.</p>
			<p>The use case may be simple here, but often, AWS builders in the organization receive complex requirements from the business that require methodical planning, research, and execution. The assumption is that AWS builders have a general sense of many of the AWS services, their features, and how they can help solve a use case. However, not every builder is the same, and not everyone has the same level of expertise. Some are entry-level builders who rely heavily on research and guidance from senior builders, while others know how to solve a use case but may not be familiar with all the best practices and alternative design patterns.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important reminder: LLM-based solutions do not always return the same results</p>
			<p class="callout">LLMs do not inherently produce idempotent results when deployed in applications. There are a few reasons for this:</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Stochasticity</strong>: Most LLMs use some element of randomness when generating outputs, such as sampling from a probability distribution. This means each invocation will produce slightly different results.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Continuous learning</strong>: Many deployed LLMs continue training on new data, constantly updating their parameters. The model is essentially continuously changing, so results will evolve.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Interactivity</strong>: Conversational AI systems based on LLMs accumulate context and history, which impacts subsequent responses. The results depend on prior interactions.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">External dependencies</strong>: Applications may pull in external data that influences the LLM’s outputs. If that data changes, the outputs will as well.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Multimodal inputs</strong>: For LLMs that process images, audio, and so on, in addition to text, variations in those inputs lead to different outputs.</p>
			<p class="callout">Since Amazon Q is also an LLM-based service, the results you see for this use case, as well as any use case you solve, may not always return the same output. Therefore, it is important to have a human in the loop to prompt it appropriately and also test and verify before deploying solutions in production.</p>
			<p>Hope you didn’t skip the preceding reminder note! Now, let’s jump straight into how Amazon Q will help expedite solving this use case.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Conversational Q&amp;A capability</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> conversational ability of Amazon Q will help us through the initial steps to better understand the use case. You can ask Amazon Q different questions, and it will try to understand what you want to do. If you are an AWS builder with some knowledge of AWS services relevant to solving this use case, you can start with a broad question to Amazon Q and then narrow down options by prompting. For example, in the following screenshot, we ask for a solution to the use case without going into too much detail about what it should look like on AWS.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.1 – Amazon Q conversational capability – general question" src="img/B21378_15_1.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1 – Amazon Q conversational capability – general question</p>
			<p>Since<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> there weren’t specific instructions in the question, Amazon Q provided a general outline of what the solution might look like. This is where you can further prompt the system to narrow down a possible solution. Since the use case requires us to build and host a simple website, we prompt Amazon Q to refine its recommendation further. The following screenshot shows this prompt and Q’s response.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.2 – Amazon Q conversational capability – prompt 1" src="img/B21378_15_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.2 – Amazon Q conversational capability – prompt 1</p>
			<p>Q understood<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> the prompt, and it provided a recommendation to use the <strong class="bold">AWS Amplify</strong> service as a simple way to host the website. As you can see through this simple example, prompting the system is a crucial step in obtaining results that are customized to the use case you are trying to solve. Since the use case requires us to build a website and it will not just be a static web page, the prompt in the following screenshot further refines the output from Q.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.3 – Amazon Q conversational capability – prompt 2" src="img/B21378_15_3.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.3 – Amazon Q conversational capability – prompt 2</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>continue along this path of prompting until you receive enough recommendations to help solve a particular use case. Amazon Q also provides sources of information so that you can read more about it.</p>
			<p>If you happen to have an idea of which AWS services you want to use for the use case, you can directly construct the very first question you ask Amazon Q with all the relevant considerations the system should make when coming up with a recommended solution. For example, in our use case, if we know that we could host the website on EC2 and then use S3 as a store to store the original and resized images, then we can prompt the system all at once, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.4 – Amazon Q conversational capability – well-defined requirements" src="img/B21378_15_4.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.4 – Amazon Q conversational capability – well-defined requirements</p>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> can see from the recommendation, Amazon Q was able to come up with a solution using some of the AWS services you would like to use to solve the use case.</p>
			<p>For the sake of a clear solution, let’s assume that with the assistance of Amazon Q, we were able to nail down the flow of the solution as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The user uploads an image through the web application interface.</li>
				<li>The web application sends the uploaded image to an Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
				<li>An S3 event notification triggers an AWS Lambda function.</li>
				<li>The Lambda function retrieves the uploaded image from the S3 bucket and initiates the image processing directly.</li>
				<li>The image processing tasks, such as resizing and compression, are performed within the Lambda function using libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.</li>
				<li>Once the image processing is complete, the Lambda function saves the processed image back to the S3 bucket or a designated location.</li>
				<li>Optionally, metadata about the processed image can be stored in a database or logging system for monitoring and analytics purposes.</li>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> processed image is now ready for retrieval and display within the web application or any other downstream systems.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following diagram shows the solution architecture for this particular use case.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.5 – Image processing pipeline – solution architecture" src="img/B21378_15_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.5 – Image processing pipeline – solution architecture</p>
			<p>Since we are highlighting features of Amazon Q that would help fast-track building solutions on AWS, not all the steps will be covered in detail here. Also, the responses you receive<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> from Q may be different from what we are getting, so we may not be able to show all the step-by-step instructions in this chapter for you to build this use case. The idea here is to show you how you can leverage these features of Q for your own use case, and at the end of the process, you will be able to quantify how much time Amazon Q saved you in the whole process based on all the steps you took, including design, development, building, testing, debugging, deployment, and documentation.</p>
			<p>We now understand how the conversational feature of Q was able to help narrow the general flow of the solution along with its architecture. Let’s understand the next feature of Amazon Q: optimally selecting the correct EC2 instance for the use case – something builders often have to decide based on the use case, taking into consideration the pros and cons of each such instance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Selecting the optimal Amazon EC2 instance</h2>
			<p>To host <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>the website, we need to get an Amazon EC2 instance up and running with an Apache HTTP server. The next question for the builder would be which EC2 instance should they select? Let’s see how Amazon Q can help.</p>
			<p>When you go to the EC2 console to launch an EC2 instance, there is now an advisor link in the <strong class="bold">Instance type</strong> section. The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Get </strong><strong class="bold">advice</strong> link.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.6 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance selection advisor" src="img/B21378_15_6.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.6 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance selection advisor</p>
			<p>For our <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>use case, we need a low-cost EC2 instance for hosting the website. We will pick the appropriate use case option, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.7 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance selection for web hosting" src="img/B21378_15_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.7 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance selection for web hosting</p>
			<p>Based<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> on our criteria, Q responds with optimal EC2 instances that we can start with for our use case. Q just helps narrow down the choices; the actual benchmarking of cost/performance still needs to be done as part of the process.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the recommended EC2 instances for web hosting, keeping costs low.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.8 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance type recommendation for web hosting" src="img/B21378_15_8.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.8 – Amazon Q – EC2 instance type recommendation for web hosting</p>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> demonstrated how Amazon Q helped select the correct type of EC2 instance based on the use case. The remaining setup to enable a website on an EC2 instance can vary depending on how the HTTP server is set up. The web server can either be bootstrapped and started when the EC2 instance is being booted or, in many cases, an <strong class="bold">Amazon Machine Image</strong> (<strong class="bold">AMI</strong>) that<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> has all the necessary setup is used to start the web server. Implementation details are out of the scope of this book as they may vary for individual use cases.</p>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>feature of Amazon Q addresses a topic that frustrates builders the most: networking issues. Builders are passionate about building applications. When they are ready to test or deploy something, networking issues can strike and derail the progress. The most frustrating part about networking is that, often, it’s very difficult to know the exact issue just based on the error message. Getting to the root cause of the issue requires networking knowledge and troubleshooting skills. This process sometimes takes a lot of time.</p>
			<p>To assist with this topic, Amazon Q provides a network troubleshooting feature that allows fast resolution of such issues in the AWS Management Console itself. Let’s get into the details of this feature.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Network troubleshooting assistance</h2>
			<p>Most <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>times, especially in production environments, all the infrastructure required for the project is configured and maintained via IaC. If the developer is tasked with setting up the networking themselves, preferably in a dev account, then they can start by asking Amazon Q about the steps required to set up networking for our use case.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the steps listed by Q for setting up networking for a public-facing website.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.9 – Amazon Q – networking recommendation for web hosting" src="img/B21378_15_9.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.9 – Amazon Q – networking recommendation for web hosting</p>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>you set up all the networking elements such as a VPC, a subnet, route tables, and so forth, you can then verify whether the setup is correct or not. For specific network analysis, Amazon Q relies on VPC Reachability Analyzer to provide explanations and detailed path analysis.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, Amazon Q’s network troubleshooting feature checked whether the VPC we set up can connect to the internet.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.10 – Amazon Q – networking recommendation for web hosting" src="img/B21378_15_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.10 – Amazon Q – networking recommendation for web hosting</p>
			<p>The ability of <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>Amazon Q to work in tandem with VPC Reachability Analyzer saves countless hours spent trying to troubleshoot what went wrong in the networking configuration. Once you fix the issues, you can also confirm whether the desired networking state is achieved by asking Amazon Q simple questions.</p>
			<p>For instance, the following screenshot shows the builder checking whether the EC2 instance has connectivity to the internet, and Q will provide the result along with the networking path details.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.11 – Amazon Q – internet connection check for web hosting" src="img/B21378_15_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.11 – Amazon Q – internet connection check for web hosting</p>
			<p>We just<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> showed a couple of questions to showcase the capability of Amazon Q; however, in real scenarios, you can ask it many more networking questions, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can you help me figure out why I can’t connect from the bastion host to my private instance in the application subnet?</li>
				<li>Which of my security groups are preventing access to my Amazon Aurora database?</li>
				<li>Why am I not able to SSH into EC2 instance i-xxxx?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> problems are not easy to solve or there might be some other issues with the service you are using. In such instances, you can also use Amazon Q to quickly raise a support case with AWS. Let’s quickly look at this aspect.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Chatting with AWS Support</h2>
			<p>If at any <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>point you are not able to troubleshoot an issue, you can ask Amazon Q to help you talk to someone in support, by asking Q to engage support directly. The following screenshot shows the options provided if you have just a basic support plan. When you have premium plans, it will allow you to create a support case right from the Q console. A link to different AWS Support plans is provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.12 – Amazon Q – support case" src="img/B21378_15_12.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.12 – Amazon Q – support case</p>
			<p>The other option is to first see if Q can assist with the issue. If the response provided by Q does not seem to help, you can also click the thumbs-down icon in Q, and it will help you create a support case, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.13 – Amazon Q –support case by clicking the thumbs-down icon" src="img/B21378_15_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.13 – Amazon Q –support case by clicking the thumbs-down icon</p>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> way, it will also allow you to create a support case from the Q chat itself, with the issue context auto-populating support case fields. This saves time as you don’t have to leave the screen to fill out a separate support case.</p>
			<p>Our use case can now move forward with the next building block. Let’s continue, and while solving the next portion of our use case, we will also introduce another key feature of Amazon Q.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Troubleshooting console errors with Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>demonstrate the next feature of Amazon Q, let’s move on to the next step of the solution, which involves creating a Lambda function. This function will be triggered when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket from the website. The Lambda function will utilize an image processing library to resize the image and then place it in another S3 bucket. Additionally, the Lambda function will update the metadata for the resized image in a database, enabling the website to reference it and retrieve the correct image from the S3 bucket to display on certain web pages.</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> previous chapter, we demonstrated how Amazon Q can accelerate AWS Lambda code generation. Using the same techniques, you can auto-generate the Lambda function logic for this use case as well. The following is a sample Lambda function for our use case. It highlights the core image processing part without all the necessary additional features. The code is for your reference only and you can use Amazon Q to help generate the code on your behalf. The output may vary if we try to regenerate it, so care should be taken to validate its correctness:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import boto3
from PIL import Image
import io
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the S3 bucket and key from the event
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    source_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    source_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    # Download the original image from S3
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=source_bucket, Key=source_key)
    image_content = response['Body'].read()
    # Open the image using PIL
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_content))
    # Resize the image
    resized_image = image.resize((200, 200))  # Adjust the size as needed
    # Upload the resized image to a new S3 bucket
    destination_bucket = 'your-destination-bucket-name'
    destination_key = f"resized/{source_key}"
    # Save the resized image to a BytesIO object
    resized_image_io = io.BytesIO()
    resized_image.save(resized_image_io, format='JPEG')  # Change the format if needed
    resized_image_io.seek(0)
    # Upload the resized image to S3
    s3.put_object(Bucket=destination_bucket, Key=destination_key, 
        Body=resized_image_io)
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Image resized and uploaded successfully!'
    }</pre>			<p>We will set <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>up this Lambda function and add a trigger for invocation whenever an object is created in the source S3 bucket. So, every time the website uploads an image to this bucket, the “create object” event in S3 will trigger the Lambda function.</p>
			<p>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> screenshot shows the Lambda trigger that we added.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.14 – AWS Lambda function – event trigger" src="img/B21378_15_14.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.14 – AWS Lambda function – event trigger</p>
			<p>During the build lifecycle, builders often spend a significant amount of time debugging and fixing issues encountered during testing. Before Amazon Q, builders had to do their own research to understand what an error was and how to fix it. But now, with Amazon Q, builders can troubleshoot errors directly from the AWS Management Console. Let’s explore this feature and understand how we can use it to troubleshoot issues for our use case.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Troubleshooting Lambda errors with Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>AWS Management Console, Amazon Q can diagnose and address errors encountered while utilizing AWS services, including instances of insufficient permissions, misconfigurations, and exceeding service limits. This functionality is accessible for errors occurring within services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda. While Amazon Q can resolve many common console errors, it does not handle basic validation errors, and it does not retain a record of previous troubleshooting sessions.</p>
			<p>Let’s understand how we can use this feature for our use case. Now, to test whether our Lambda function is working correctly, we will use the test option available in the AWS Lambda<a id="_idIndexMarker690"/> console. For the test, we will pre-upload a sample image in the source bucket and then execute the following test:</p>

}</pre>			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>test simply simulates the event message the Lambda function would receive when an image is uploaded to the source bucket. The test feature in the Lambda console allows builders to verify whether the lambda is working as intended before the code is put into production.</p>
			<p>When we click the <strong class="bold">Test</strong> button in the AWS Lambda console, we immediately encounter an error, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>

			<p>As seen<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> from this error, it appears that the PIL module is not being recognized. The <strong class="bold">Troubleshoot with Amazon Q</strong> option appears next to the error. When you click that option, Amazon Q will first analyze the issue and provide an analysis of the issue, as seen in this case in the following screenshot.</p>

			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>you select the <strong class="bold">Help me resolve</strong> option, Amazon Q will provide a possible resolution to the problem. This way, builders don’t have to conduct external research on how to fix the error. The following screenshot shows the resolution steps for our Lambda function error.</p>

			<p>So basically, the Python Imaging Library was missing, and Amazon Q suggested steps to add it to the Lambda function. At the beginning of this use case, I added an important note regarding solutions provided by LLM-based assistants such as Amazon Q. The solution offered may vary for different invocations of Amazon Q. To demonstrate this point, I closed the resolution window and requested that Q troubleshoot the same issue again. This time, Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>came up with a different recommendation to solve this problem.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.18 – Amazon Q – resolution for AWS Lambda error – variation 1" src="img/B21378_15_18.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.18 – Amazon Q – resolution for AWS Lambda error – variation 1</p>
			<p>If I seek another instance of troubleshooting, this time, I receive another recommendation to solve the same issue, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.19 – Amazon Q – resolution to AWS Lambda error – variation 2" src="img/B21378_15_19.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.19 – Amazon Q – resolution to AWS Lambda error – variation 2</p>
			<p>Now, you<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> may wonder why this happened in this case. Firstly, a problem may have multiple solutions, and each solution has its own steps. Which solution would be the best fit for our problem is up to the builders to try and decide. Not every solution may be the best fit, as Amazon Q may not be aware of any external dependencies your team or specific implementation of the project may have. Builders need to do their due diligence in how they implement the final solution. Amazon Q just assists you in narrowing down options that may have taken you longer to research on your own.</p>
			<p>To keep moving, I adopted the recommendation provided by Amazon Q in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.14</em>. To get a quick resolution to the library issue, I added an external ARN, <code>'arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:770693421928:layer:Klayers-p312-Pillow:1'</code>, as a reference to the PIL library in my Lambda function layer section.</p>
			<p>I reran the test to see if that resolved my issue. But, immediately, I encountered a different error, as seen in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.20 – Amazon Q – another AWS Lambda error" src="img/B21378_15_20.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.20 – Amazon Q – another AWS Lambda error</p>
			<p>Looks like<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> the library issue got resolved, but the function timed out. Instead of combing through the logs for the reason for this issue, I clicked the <strong class="bold">Troubleshoot with Amazon Q</strong> button again. The following screenshot shows the analysis of the issue along with the resolution provided by Amazon Q.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.21 – Amazon Q – analysis and resolution for the AWS Lambda timeout error" src="img/B21378_15_21.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.21 – Amazon Q – analysis and resolution for the AWS Lambda timeout error</p>
			<p>Sometimes, simple<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> issues cause frustration and waste time trying to figure out the cause. Amazon Q understood the issue and provided exact steps to resolve the problem in seconds. This example may be simple but it highlights the productivity gains all AWS builders will experience once they start leveraging Amazon Q to troubleshoot issues in the AWS Management Console.</p>
			<p>Finally, after increasing the timeout, the Lambda test was completed successfully, and the following screenshot confirms that the image was resized.</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.22 – Amazon Q – successful execution of the AWS Lambda function</p>
			<p>You can check the destination S3 bucket to find a resized image in there.</p>
			<p>This brings <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>us to the end of our use case; however, another feature of Q can help you understand what resources exist in your account. In other words, Amazon Q is also aware of the AWS resources that are being used in your accounts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Awareness of AWS account resources</h1>
			<p>So far in <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>this chapter, we have seen how Amazon Q assists builders in creating solutions on AWS by generating architecture patterns, best practices, and also code. But what if the builders need assistance with AWS resources that are already built in their AWS account and want to know more details about them without having to find this information individually? Amazon Q is now not only aware of the AWS resources in your account but can also answer questions about costs, helping you better understand and create optimization strategies. Let’s quickly look at these features.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Analyzing resources with Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>you ask Q to analyze your resources, ensure that IAM permissions are granted for the action you are asking Q to perform. For example, if you are asking Q to list all S3 buckets in your account, then the <code>s3:ListAllMyBuckets</code> IAM permission must be granted.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows all the EC2 instances I used for my use case.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.23 – Amazon Q – AWS resource analysis" src="img/B21378_15_23.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.23 – Amazon Q – AWS resource analysis</p>
			<p>You can ask refined questions to get many such insights into the AWS resources that you have provisioned. In the following screenshot, we are checking the encryption settings for the bucket we provisioned for our use case in this chapter.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.24 – Amazon Q – AWS resource setting analysis" src="img/B21378_15_24.jpg"/>

			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>conclude this chapter, we definitely want to know the costs associated with the use case. In fact, all teams using AWS for their workloads explore costs along with their management to ensure expenses do not proliferate due to unnecessary actions. Amazon Q can help with this aspect too.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Analyzing costs with Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>Amazon Q<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> enables seamless cost management by retrieving, explaining, and analyzing your cost data, allowing you to understand your expenses.</p>
			<p>When you inquire about your costs, Amazon Q provides detailed responses that include specific cost figures, associated metrics, time periods, and granular details, along with any applied groups or filters. Additionally, it offers a link to an AWS Cost Explorer view with the same specifications, enabling you to visualize or download the data for further analysis.</p>
			<p>The following is a simple example of asking Q for costs for our EC2 instances for a particular month of the year.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.25 – Amazon Q – AWS cost analysis" src="img/B21378_15_25.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.25 – Amazon Q – AWS cost analysis</p>
			<p>For Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>to analyze the costs, AWS Cost Explorer needs to be enabled. After that, you can chat with Q and ask any variation of cost exploration questions, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How much did we spend on EC2 in 2024?</li>
				<li>What were my EC2 costs by instance types for the past 6 months?</li>
				<li>Which linked accounts spent the most on Redshift last month?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This brings us to the end of the chapter; however, we are just scratching the surface in terms of what Amazon Q can do. With generative AI rapidly evolving, expect many more new features and capabilities in Amazon Q pertaining to solving use cases in AWS.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered how Amazon Q can assist in building solutions on AWS. Amazon Q helps with many aspects of the build process, including providing architecture patterns and best practices, diagnosing AWS console errors, troubleshooting networking issues, creating support cases, and understanding all provisioned AWS resources along with their costs.</p>
			<p>In the next and final chapter, we will look at another key aspect for DevOps builders and how Amazon Q can help fast-track many aspects of it.</p>
