- en: The media attention around deepfakes often focuses on the ills and dangers of
    the technology. Even many of the articles about what deepfakes can do fail to
    account for why you might want to do it. The truth is that deepfakes bring new
    techniques and abilities to neural networks for those who know how to use them.

    AI, especially when traditional methods fall short. Join us as we explore what
    deepfakes are, what they can be used for, and how they may change in the future.

    for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We take a zero-tolerance approach to
    anyone using Faceswap for any unethical purposes and actively discourage any such

    start at the beginning. If you want to skip straight to the code, then you’ll
    want to look at *Part 2* (though we hope you’ll give *Part 1* a peruse once you’re
    ready). If you only care about what you can do with the techniques moving forward,
    then check out *Part 3* (but I promise that the earlier parts have some juicy
    nuggets of information).

    at what software is available to make deepfakes. After that, we’ll examine the
    ethics of deepfakes, including the unsavory beginnings, and build a framework

    important part of creating a deepfake: data, including explanations of what makes
