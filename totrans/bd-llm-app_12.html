<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Responsible AI </span><a id="_idIndexMarker902"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">refers to the ethical and accountable development, deployment, and use of AI systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">It involves ensuring fairness, transparency, privacy, and avoiding biases in AI algorithms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Responsible AI also encompasses considerations for the social impact and consequences of AI technologies, promoting accountability and human-centric design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Responsible AI plays a crucial role in steering decisions toward positive and fair results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">This involves prioritizing people and their objectives in the design of systems while upholding enduring values such as fairness, reliability, and transparency.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Some ethical implications</span><a id="_idIndexMarker903"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1"> of Responsible AI are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Bias</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">: AI systems can inherit biases present in their training data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes, reinforcing existing inequalities.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Explainability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">: Black-box models (such as LLMs) lack interpretability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Efforts are being made to create more interpretable models to enhance trust and accountability.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Data protection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">: Collecting, storing, and processing data responsibly is essential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Consent, anonymization, and data minimization principles should guide AI development.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Liability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">: Determining liability for AI decisions (especially in critical domains) remains a challenge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Legal frameworks need to evolve to address this.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Human oversight</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">: AI should complement human decision-making rather than replace it entirely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Human judgment is essential, especially in high-stakes contexts.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Environmental impact</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">: Training large models consumes significant energy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Responsible AI considers environmental impacts and explores energy-efficient alternatives.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">: Ensuring AI systems are secure and resistant to attacks is crucial.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">As an example of addressing these implications, Microsoft has established a framework called the Responsible AI Standard (</span><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf"><span class="url"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf</span></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">), outlining six principles:</span></p>
<ul>

<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Accountability</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">In the context of generative AI, Responsible AI would mean creating models that respect these principles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">For instance, the generated content should be fair and inclusive, not favoring any particular group or promoting any form of discrimination. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">The models should be reliable and safe to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">They should respect user’s privacy and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">The process of generation should be transparent, and there should be mechanisms for accountability.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Generally speaking, there </span><a id="_idIndexMarker904"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">are many levels at which we can intervene to make a whole LLM-powered application safer and more robust: the model level, the metaprompt level, and the user interface level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">This architecture can be illustrated as follows:</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Of course, it is not always possible to work at all levels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">For example, in the case of ChatGPT, we consume a pre-built application with a black-box model and a fixed UX, so we have little room for intervention only at the metaprompt level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">On the other hand, if we leverage open-source models via an API, we can act up to the model level to incorporate Responsible AI principles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">Let’s now see a description of each layer of mitigation.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Another example traces back to the first experiments with ChatGPT, in December 2022, when it exhibited some sexist and racist comments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">A recent tweet highlighted this example, asking ChatGPT to create a Python function assessing a person’s aptitude as a scientist based on their race and gender.</span></p>
