- en: Learning how to apply AI is crucial and can take the fun factor to the next
    level when developing traditional, educational, or any other kind of game. Unreal
    Engine is a powerful game development engine that allows you to create 2D and
    3D games. If you want to use AI to extend the life of your games and make them
    challenging and more interesting, this book is for you.

- en: The book starts with breaking down **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) into
    simple concepts to get a fundamental understanding of it. Using a variety of examples,
    you will work through actual implementations designed to highlight key concepts
    and features related to game AI in UE4\. You will learn how to work through the
    built-in AI framework to build believable characters for every genre (e.g. RPG,
    Strategic, Platform, FPS, Simulation, Arcade, and Educational games). You will
    learn how to configure *Navigation*, *Environmental Querying* and *Sensory* systems
    for your AI agents and couple it with *Behavior Trees*, all with practical examples.
    You will then explore how the engine handles dynamic crowd. In the concluding
    chapters, you will learn how to profile, visualize and debug your AI systems,
    to correct the AI logic, and increase performance.

    will be deep and comprehensive, allowing you to build powerful AI agents within
    your projects.

- en: This book is for you if you are a game developer with a bit experience in Unreal
    Engine, and now want to understand and implement believable game AI within Unreal
    Engine. The book will be both in Blueprint and C++, allowing people from every
    background to enjoy the book. Whether you're looking to build your first game
    or to expand your knowledge as a Game AI Programmer, you will find plenty of exciting
    information and examples of game AI in terms of concepts and implementation, including
    how to extend some of these systems.
