			<p class="calibre3">This book combines <strong class="bold">User Experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) expertise with ChatGPT and related <strong class="bold">Large Language Models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) to create enterprise-grade applications that can solve real business problems. This is done in a way that almost all of the learnings of the books will continue to apply to the latest LLMs as they evolve and improve. We focus on the integration of LLMs with business solutions. This includes creating customer chatbots for customer service, creating recommender solutions to offer suggestions for sales and service, making purchase choices, solving other business problems in any vertical, or helping create more effective behind-the-scenes solutions that contain little or no UX. We take the science and art of UI design and research methods, techniques, and recommendations to make LLM solutions functional, usable, necessary, and engaging. Tips and expert secrets on applying UX to every stage of the design of LLM solutions at scale are shared. Almost none of this material is on the Internet or shared at vendor sites, so it is a unique resource for the design and design adjacent community.</p>
			<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-8" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">This book would appeal to individuals interested in enhancing their knowledge and skills in UI/UX design and looking for a comprehensive guide incorporating the latest technologies to apply UX principles to create enterprise-grade ChatGPT-powered solutions. It is suitable for seasoned designers looking to expand their knowledge, as well as writers, linguists, product managers, and design-savvy engineers who need to know UI/UX design fundamentals as they apply to ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The book follows a design-centered approach to producing ChatGPT-based solutions to solve business or “enterprise” problems. It helps decide and prioritize customer use cases for generative AI, accelerates the value from an LLM, extends the platform to serve customer needs, and explains monitoring and improving the quality of that service. Learning these skills will give you conversational AI design superpowers. An enterprise or business-class ChatGPT-powered solution should focus on providing customers with a unique skill, something more intelligent and focused than they can get from generic generative AI. To imagine and create world-class LLM-powered solutions, this book is for you.</p>
			<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-9" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor008" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Recognizing the Power of Design in ChatGPT</em>, begins with a brief introduction to the relationship between design and LLMs, including the art and science of UX and the history of LLMs. The various design frameworks for deploying an LLM are discussed, including a chat UI, a hybrid UI that includes chat with graphical user interfaces, recommender UIs that are not interactive, and designs intended to work behind the scenes with backend solutions. There is a small hands-on lab for building a simple model using a no-code playground.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em>, provides many tips and tricks for using some of the most critical user research tools to evaluate adding ChatGPT and LLMs to enterprise solutions. We cover methods such as surveys, needs analysis, interviews, and digging into data to create a conversational analysis.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identifying Optimal Use Cases for ChatGPT</em>, teaches how to identify the breadth of solutions to which an LLM can add value and explains when an LLM is not suited for a use case. We briefly cover classic use case design and then spend time aligning an LLM’s capabilities with user goals. We ensure you know ChatGPT’s limitations and biases and how to handle inappropriate responses.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em>, helps you become an expert in prioritizing user stories. This chapter is also valuable after a product or service goes to customers. You learn to prioritize updates, patches, and bug fixes so the customer gets the most value from the team’s efforts. You will be able to balance customer priorities with the cost of development and make rational decisions to help plan and deliver the most value for the least cost. It explains in simple terms how to apply some special Agile tools to prioritize all this work. No road is without some bumps, but we share some complexities so you can navigate this successfully with the entire team.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_05_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining the Desired Experience</em>, is the final chapter before we get serious about the inner workings of ChatGPT. You will uncover specific considerations, design issues, and solutions for the full range of contexts of use. These include chat experiences, hybrid UIs (a graphical user interface merged with chat intelligence), recommendation UIs, and backend solutions (those without a customer-facing UI). We will address overarching considerations for these desired experiences, ensuring you know how to handle accessibility and internationalization while creating trust and handling security in any of these solutions.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content Is King</em>, dives into the complex nature of enterprise data, which is fundamental to creating a ChatGPT solution based on customers’ needs. Explore how data sources such as knowledge bases, databases, spreadsheets, and other systems provide a source of truth. This helps connect customers to actions and explains how product people like yourself can contribute at this stage. Hands-on activities and a case study on annotating and cleaning data help explain the key points. We will cover retrieval augmented generation to help bridge the gap between an enterprise’s vast data sources and the LLM.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Prompt Engineering</em>, coaches you on creating instructions that control, adapt, and personify the communications from the LLM to the customer. You will learn the difference between prompts anyone can give to an LLM and the more refined nature of instructional prompts for enterprise solutions.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Fine-Tuning</em>, explains what happens within the fine-tuning process, provides a tutorial on how to start fine-tuning, and continues our in-depth case study. You will be shown different methods to apply when training models. This includes a hands-on exercise to fine-tune a very sarcastic chatbot.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines and Heuristics</em>, steps past the technical nature of ChatGPT design to examine how to interpret ChatGPT style, tone, and voice. Essential guidelines and heuristics adapted and applied to evaluating ChatGPT solutions are reviewed so you can learn how to use design thinking to create clarity in the output from your LLM solutions. Dozens of examples are provided, along with a case study and example prompts that tie together the suite of heuristics covered in the chapter.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_10_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring and Evaluation</em>, focuses on knowing if the solution is doing well. It covers evaluating successes and failures, defining quality, and judging whether the UX improves. Our approach is one of care and feeding, following the life cycle of learning from the product’s users and feeding back any learnings to have it grow and mature. Statistical measures of model performance, user quality metrics, and heuristic evaluation methods are covered, with tips on improving quality.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor236" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Process</em>, focuses on adapting traditional Agile and modern development methods to more interactive and customer-driven needs to improve ChatGPT solutions rapidly. We cover practical strategies to integrate a care and feeding approach into traditional Agile or Agile-like development while explaining why you should advocate for a continuous improvement life cycle.</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusion</em>, is the final chapter and provides additional suggestions and coaching to wrap up the entire life cycle covered in this book to set you up for success.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor009" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">We make no assumptions about any existing use of ChatGPT to build business solutions. We expect everyone to use some form of LLM for personal use. We would like some basic familiarity with UI terms and techniques, even if you are not an expert or a UI professional. We talk about creating surveys, carrying out customer interviews, and giving lots of tips and tricks, but assume a basic understanding of these techniques. References are provided to get you up to speed in places where a knowledge roadblock might appear.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The entire book can be followed without coding; we rely on ChatGPT’s free playground experience. We dabble in a few other free resources and LLMs. You will need an account to access our GitHub files and ChatGPT. If you code or are more technical, explore some of the more advanced topics and links provided. Although the book and tutorials are focused on ChatGPT, the learnings in the book can apply to any LLM.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">For those in the digital version of the book, you can cut and paste examples directly into ChatGPT. However, no programming or code examples are needed, so missing a comma, for instance, will not impact your ability to learn and follow along. We provide files with sample data; you can use those without issue and test and experiment with the latest LLMs.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We have a solution for readers of the physical book who want quick access to the references and resources or those who notice an out-of-date link because web pages and companies come and go. We are maintaining a single-page online reference guide for all links, articles, demos, videos, and books mentioned in the book. Each chapter has a QR code that links to online references listed from every chapter. This means the links will be able to be updated on the reference website as this emerging field grows.</p>
