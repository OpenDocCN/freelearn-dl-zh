- en: Every good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. In this part, we’ll
    start our journey by exploring how traditional user experience methods and best
    practices can be applied to creating world-class solutions powered by ChatGPT.
    We will then explore essential user research methods and provide tips and secrets
    of the trade that work when creating conversational designs. This will lead us
    to explore how to define and pick the use cases that **large language models**
    (**LLMs**) are best suited to solve. A user experience approach is taught to prioritize
    use cases. When combined with a method to include development costs into the mix,
    this powerful method from Agile allows for prioritizing the most valuable solutions
    to build. Although we’ll consider how these use cases play out with ChatGPT, almost
    all the learnings can apply to any LLM model. We’ll look at LLM-powered applications,
    chat-only experiences, and robust chat-powered graphical user interfaces, and
    we’ll even explain how to work with ChatGPT when there is no UI.
