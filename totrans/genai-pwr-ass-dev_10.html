			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following key topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prerequisites for Amazon Q customizations</li>
				<li>Creating customization in Amazon Q</li>
				<li>Evaluating and optimizing the customization</li>
				<li>Creating different versions of customization</li>
				<li>Adding users and groups</li>
				<li>Using customization in integrated development environments (IDEs)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With customizations, <strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer</strong> can support software development tailored to your team’s internal libraries, proprietary algorithms, and enterprise code style. By connecting a data source containing your code, Amazon Q leverages your content to provide assistance that aligns with your organization’s development style.</p>
			<p>Let’s get started by looking at some of the prerequisites before you can leverage customization with Amazon Q.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Prerequisites for Amazon Q customizations</h1>
			<p>Since customization<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> is mostly used by organizations, it is only available with the Pro tier of Amazon Q Developer. However, you can also try it out on your own by getting the Pro subscription and adding the customization feature from the Amazon Q administrative console.</p>
			<p>When using Amazon Q customizations, ensure that your Amazon Q administrator is authorized to access your code base, which can be stored either on <strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong> or through <strong class="bold">AWS CodeConnections</strong>. Notably, in the standard setup procedure for Amazon Q Developer Pro, your <strong class="bold">AWS Organizations </strong>administrator doesn’t grant the Amazon Q administrator access to these services.</p>
			<p>Hence, before utilizing<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> Amazon Q customizations, it’s imperative to include the following permissions to the role of your Amazon Q administrator. Note the legacy name of <strong class="bold">CodeWhisperer</strong> still shows in the policy, even though it pertains to Amazon Q Developer now:</p>

When preparing your data source, incorporate code that features team-endorsed patterns while avoiding code that contains anti-patterns, bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and similar concerns. Organizations establish best-of-breed coding standards and patterns by creating comprehensive guidelines and best practices that are thoroughly documented and easily accessible to all developers. They enforce these standards through code reviews and security standards in the development projects. All organizations can decide for themselves what project code repositories are gold standards for them so that they can use those for customizations in Amazon Q Developer.</p>
			<p>Your data source should include between 2 MB and 20 GB of source code files in supported languages. The Amazon CloudWatch logs will indicate the total size of all the code bases used during the customization training process. In our next few sections, we will highlight this aspect in the logs. There is no restriction on the number of files, but ensure each language<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> you wish to support includes at least 10 files. If using Amazon S3 as the data source, organize all source code within a directory, avoiding placement at the root level, as files at the root level will be disregarded.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Supported languages</p>
			<p class="callout">At this time, Amazon Q Developer supports customization for Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript programming languages, and it can be used from the VS Code and JetBrains IDEs only. Keep an eye on new releases that may include more options.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s learn how to create the customization in Amazon Q Developer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Creating a customization in Amazon Q</h1>
			<p>To get <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>started with customizations, first set them up in the Amazon Q Developer console. We assume you have already followed the steps to set up your Pro tier.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the customization settings inside the Amazon Q Developer console. To access the Amazon Q Developer console, search for the service name within the AWS console and click the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> button to reach the following screen.</p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.1 – Amazon Q customizations setup" src="img/B21378_10_001.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – Amazon Q customizations setup</p>
			<p>After that, click <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>on the <strong class="bold">Customization</strong> link and follow a simple three-step process inside the <strong class="bold">Customizations</strong> page: connecting to a repository, creating customization, and activating it. The following screenshot shows the process.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.2 – Amazon Q customizations – creation process" src="img/B21378_10_002.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Amazon Q customizations – creation process</p>
			<p>Let’s look at these<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> steps one by one.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Connecting to a repository</h2>
			<p>As soon <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>as you click the <strong class="bold">Create customization</strong> button in the console, you will be presented with a page where you can provide the name and description for the customization along with the connection to the source repository, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.3 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a connection" src="img/B21378_10_003.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a connection</p>
			<p>Always try to give a <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>meaningful name and clear description here, as this information will be visible to the developers from the IDE.</p>
			<p>The important aspect in the preceding screenshot is the source connection. There are two ways to make your source code available to Amazon Q for creating the customization. You can take all the source code in the organization, upload it into an Amazon S3 bucket, and provide the S3 URI in the source connection. Many organizations that store large amounts of enterprise code in code repositories as part of the DevOps process are less likely to use this option. The other option is indeed to connect to the code repositories where the code is hosted.</p>
			<p>If your data<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> source resides on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you need to establish a connection to it using AWS CodeConnections. To demonstrate the customization feature in this chapter, I will connect to my GitHub repository, where I will be leveraging some public repositories that I will fork for this to work. For detailed steps on how to create a connection to your repository, I have provided the link in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter so that you can go through it step by step to create a connection and put the connection in the Amazon Q customization creation page.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the bottom part of the same customization creation page, which allows you to emit the logs generated during this process to one of the log delivery options. In this case, I have picked AWS CloudWatch, and in the subsequent steps, I will show you the importance of logs during this process.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.4 – Amazon Q customizations – log delivery option" src="img/B21378_10_004.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.4 – Amazon Q customizations – log delivery option</p>
			<p>Once you<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> hit the <strong class="bold">Create customization</strong> button, it begins the training process. Depending on the total size of the code base, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours or even more.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Preparing customizations</h2>
			<p>In this step, Amazon Q <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>will connect to your code repository and train a custom model based on your organization’s coding practices so that it can utilize your content to provide suggestions tailored to the preferences of your organization’s developers.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Security note</p>
			<p class="callout">AWS will neither store nor utilize your content in any context that doesn’t directly benefit your enterprise. Also, AWS won’t leverage your content to offer code suggestions to other customers, and, of course, Amazon Q will not refer to security scans conducted for other customers.</p>
			<p>During<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> this process, Amazon Q retrieves the source code from the code repository, and after conducting sanity and quality checks, such as duplicate file checks and unsupported file formats, it attempts to establish whether it has enough context to create a customization that would benefit all the developers in the organization.</p>
			<p>After running for a bit, the customization creation page failed and provided me with an error stating that the code size was not large enough for it to train an effective model. This issue is highlighted in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.5 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a customization failure" src="img/B21378_10_005.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.5 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a customization failure</p>
			<p>The error <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>doesn’t exactly tell me what was insufficient and how it fell below the minimum threshold in our code base during this process. This is where the CloudWatch Logs will come in handy. For many possible troubleshooting error messages, you can follow the link in the <em class="italic">References</em> section, but I will cover one such error that I encountered during this process.</p>
			<p>If you navigate to the CloudWatch log group link provided during the customization setup, as shown in the <strong class="bold">Log deliveries</strong> section in <em class="italic">Figure 10</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, you will be able to see the exact cause of this error. For instance, in my case, the error log, as seen in the following screenshot, suggests that after the quality scrub process, Amazon Q could only gather about 1 MB of code. This limit is below the minimum threshold of 2 MB required by the engine to proceed toward the customization training process.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.6 – Amazon Q customizations – failure details in AWS CloudWatch" src="img/B21378_10_006.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.6 – Amazon Q customizations – failure details in AWS CloudWatch</p>
			<p>The reason <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>for this insufficient data error is that I had forked a popular code repository from the public code samples provided by AWS on GitHub, located at <code>https://github.com/aws-samples.</code></p>
			<p>In reality, as part of the organization, your administrator will connect the Amazon Q customization to your private enterprise repositories to allow Amazon Q to train customizations based on vast amounts of code used within your organization. To demonstrate the customization in this book, I cannot use any private code, so the best I can do is show this feature by connecting to a public repository with a license that allows anyone to use the code in any way they want.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the public code found in the code repository may very well have been used to train Amazon Q Developer anyway, so technically, I will not be getting real customizations. However, to show you the steps of how it works, this should serve its purpose.</p>
			<p>After<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> receiving that failure message, I understood that I needed to provide a lot more code samples and possibly more variety for the training to work in the first place. So, I went ahead and forked a few more repositories in my GitHub account so that Amazon Q could make it past that error step. I reran the customization creation process and after a while, I looked at the CloudWatch logs again to see whether adding more code repositories helped it get past the minimum threshold.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows that it barely made it past the 2 MB minimum threshold required.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.7 – Amazon Q customizations – AWS CloudWatch logs after modified re-run" src="img/B21378_10_007.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.7 – Amazon Q customizations – AWS CloudWatch logs after modified re-run</p>
			<p>So, even after adding 5 to 6 repositories, the code size was still just above 2 MB. The recommendation is to have at least 2 MB and this can go all the way up to 20 GB of code base. So, it’s pretty evident that the customization process will complete, but I am not expecting a great evaluation from this.</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> following screenshot shows the customization was completed successfully; however, it gave me an abysmal evaluation score of 1. In other words, it’s telling me I better not roll out this customization feature to all the developers in my organization as it will yield poor results.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.8 – Amazon Q customizations – customization creation is complete" src="img/B21378_10_008.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.8 – Amazon Q customizations – customization creation is complete</p>
			<p>We will discuss score evaluation and how to improve it in our next section, but let’s complete the third step in this creation process, which is to activate the created customization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Activating and deactivating customizations</h2>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>customization is created, it needs to be activated. Since this was our first version, we will activate it even though the evaluation<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> is not great. However, in reality, you can keep iterating through the customization creation process until you get a good evaluation score, and then activate the version you want to use as the final one.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Activate</strong> option once the customization creation is complete. Once activated, the status will show as activated. You can also deactivate any customization <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>version by selecting the <strong class="bold">Deactivate</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Action</strong> dropdown. This is useful for <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>keeping only the version with the best score active for use.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.9 – Amazon Q customizations – activate a version of the customization" src="img/B21378_10_009.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.9 – Amazon Q customizations – activate a version of the customization</p>
			<p>Now, let’s learn about the score evaluation process and how you can improve it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Evaluating and optimizing the customization</h1>
			<p>When the<a id="_idIndexMarker471"/> customization process completed, it gave an evaluation score, and on the side, it also provided a detailed range of scores and a<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> description of what they mean. Let’s discuss them in detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Score evaluation</h2>
			<p>Based <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>on your evaluation score, you should now decide whether to activate your customization. Consider the following factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Very good (8-10)</strong>: Amazon Q recommends activating this customization.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fair (5-7)</strong>: Amazon Q recommends activating this customization. If you do not see a significant improvement, consider the following optimization suggestions. If those are not effective, consider switching to a different code source.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poor (1-4)</strong>: This customization is unlikely to be useful. Consider the optimization suggestions from the next section around optimizing the customization. If those are not effective, consider switching to a different code source.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This evaluation<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> matrix is suggested in the AWS documentation, a link to which is also provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights this evaluation score for our version of the customization and on the side highlights what each range of score means.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.10 – Amazon Q customizations – score evaluation criteria" src="img/B21378_10_010.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.10 – Amazon Q customizations – score evaluation criteria</p>
			<p>So, how do we go about bumping this score up? Let’s take a look.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Optimizing the customization</h2>
			<p>Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> highlight some suggestions that may improve your evaluation score.</p>
			<p>To tailor optimizations for the specific languages used in your organization, consider broadening your data source to encompass more code repositories. If your data set is limited to a few programming languages, try incorporating a wider variety of languages. Additionally, exclude auto-generated files and repositories or those created from templates, as training customizations for such files typically adds little value and introduces noise.</p>
			<p>Assess whether your code base frequently employs internal libraries. If not, the core Amazon Q model may already be performing at its best. To fine-tune for particular languages, ensure you include at least 20 data files for each language, with a total size of at least 10 MB. Essentially, by increasing and improving the variety, quality, and quantity of code used for training customizations, the evaluation score may improve. A higher evaluation score will help generate better-customized code suggestions. Once you figure out how you are going to optimize the customization, you can create multiple versions of it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Creating multiple versions of customization</h1>
			<p>As organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> create new code repositories and establish new coding standards, there may be a need to retain the Amazon Q Developer customizations to incorporate additional customizations and improve the evaluation score of an existing customization. This is where <strong class="bold">versioning</strong> of customizations comes in handy, allowing you to keep different versions of customizations based on training.</p>
			<p>Creating multiple versions of customization is easy in Amazon Q Developer. From the created customization page where you see the current version, you can select <strong class="bold">Create new version</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> dropdown and start building a new version, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.11 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a new version of customization" src="img/B21378_10_011.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.11 – Amazon Q customizations – creating a new version of customization</p>
			<p>Amazon Q<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> administrators can access up to three versions for each customization: the latest version, the currently active version in use, and the most recently active version that is no longer in use.</p>
			<p>Once the customization version has an acceptable evaluation score, the admin can make it available to users or groups.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Adding users and groups to the customization</h1>
			<p>Adding<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> users or groups is straightforward. This step will allow developers access to the customizations when they start coding in either the VS Code or JetBrains IDE, both of which would already have the Amazon Q extension installed.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Add Users/Groups</strong> tab in the Amazon Q console.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.12 – Amazon Q customizations – add users/groups" src="img/B21378_10_012.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.12 – Amazon Q customizations – add users/groups</p>
			<p>In this case, as<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> seen from the following screenshot, I’m adding myself so that I can start using the customizations in the VS Code IDE. Keep in mind this is the AWS IAM Identity Center user we configured using the steps listed in <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.13 – Amazon Q customizations – added a user" src="img/B21378_10_013.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.13 – Amazon Q customizations – added a user</p>
			<p>Now, we are all set to start using the customization from the IDE.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Using customization in IDEs</h1>
			<p>Once<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> the admin gives the thumbs-up to start using a particular customization, it’s straightforward to start using it from the IDE.</p>
			<p>Just a reminder that customizations are only available in the Pro tier, which means that you have to log into the IDE using your IAM Identity Center credentials. The following screenshot highlights that as soon as I log in to the VS Code IDE using my IAM Identity Center credentials, it gives me a notification that I have access to a new Amazon Q customization.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.14 – Amazon Q customizations – new customization notification in VS Code IDE" src="img/B21378_10_014.jpg"/>

			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.15 – Amazon Q customizations – selecting a customization in VS Code IDE" src="img/B21378_10_015.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.15 – Amazon Q customizations – selecting a customization in VS Code IDE</p>
			<p>As soon as you select that, voilà, you are notified that all new Amazon Q code suggestions will be coming from the selected customization. This is highlighted in the following screenshot.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.16 – Amazon Q customizations – customization selection confirmation in VS Code IDE" src="img/B21378_10_016.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.16 – Amazon Q customizations – customization selection confirmation in VS Code IDE</p>
			<p>Now, keep <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>in mind that Amazon Q will attempt to provide you with custom suggestions wherever it finds code logic that it would create from the custom training data. In case it’s not able to relate to the customized model, Amazon Q will provide suggestions from the default model.</p>
			<p>You can get custom code suggestions either through an inline prompt or by using the chat feature of Amazon Q Developer. For example, imagine you are working at a large e-commerce company with many customer-facing shopping applications, and as a developer for a new application, you have been tasked with building a feature that recommends items to customers. The logic for this feature may already exist in your organization. In your IDE, you can simply insert an inline prompt or use an appropriate function name such as <code>shoppingRecommendationEngine(customerId: String)</code>, and Amazon Q will try to provide the logic based on examples it has learned during the customization training process from your organization’s private repository. All the complex logic in the function, which may have been established as a gold standard in your organization, is immediately utilized without you having to understand and create all the code by hand.</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer can also answer your questions about your organization’s custom code using the chat feature. You can simply ask the chat to generate or explain code based on the use case, and Q will try to infer from what it has learned from the organization’s code base to provide the closest matching output. For example, you can ask the Amazon Q chat <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>to generate a shopping recommendation engine implementation using the k-means clustering algorithm, and it will try to suggest code based on other similar examples it has learned from your organization’s code base during the customization training process.</p>

			<p>In this chapter, we covered what code customization is in Amazon Q Developer. We started by laying out the prerequisites for Amazon Q customizations. Then, we looked at how to create customization in Amazon Q. After the creation process, the scores need to be evaluated and optimization techniques need to be put in place so that it bumps up the score in subsequent runs of the customization creation process.</p>
			<p>We also looked at how multiple versions of customizations are created and maintained. Once the customization is created, it’s assigned to users or groups by the admin. Finally, the users can log into VS Code or JetBrains IDE using their IAM Identity Center credentials to select and start using the customizations.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will look at understanding the references of the code suggestion so that appropriate actions can be taken.</p>
