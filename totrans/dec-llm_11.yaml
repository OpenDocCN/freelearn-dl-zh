  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2023, a large tech company launched an AI-powered hiring tool designed to
    streamline the recruitment process by analyzing resumes and recommending the best
    candidates. The tool, based on machine learning algorithms and an LLM, was trained
    on historical data of past hiring decisions made by the company.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    gender biases. It favored male candidates over female ones for technical positions,
    reflecting the historical bias embedded in the company’s prior hiring data. The
    model learned patterns that perpetuated gender imbalances rather than mitigating
    them. This bias raised ethical, legal, and operational concerns, putting the company
    at risk of discrimination lawsuits and reputational damage.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Securing LLMs is an essential and ongoing process that requires vigilance and
    a multi-layered strategy to counteract a spectrum of vulnerabilities. Adversarial
    attacks that manipulate data to deceive models must be countered with rigorous
    testing and well-crafted defenses. Regular vulnerability scanning and testing
    are crucial to uncover emerging threats, while proactive security measures and
    continuous security monitoring ensure that protections evolve in tandem with new
    attack vectors. Collaboration among developers, security experts, and the wider
    community enhances these efforts, forming a comprehensive defense against the
    misuse or malfunction of LLMs. These security practices, accompanied by continuous
    ethical assessments and updates, are integral to maintaining the integrity, performance,
    and reliability of LLMs, thereby ensuring they are aligned with evolving societal
    values and legal standards.
