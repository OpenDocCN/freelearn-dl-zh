    the numbers used in a model from higher precision formats, such as 32-bit floating-point,
    to lower precision formats, such as 8-bit integers. The main goals of quantization
    are to reduce the model size and to make it run faster during inference, which

    The purpose of the student model is to learn from the teacher model and replicate

    comparable or close-to-comparable performance with the teacher model. Once the
    student model is trained, it can perform inference much faster and with lower
    memory requirements compared to the teacher model, with only a small sacrifice

    a temperature parameter in the distillation loss. This parameter controls the

- en: In this chapter on performance optimization for LLMs, advanced techniques were
    introduced to enhance efficiency without compromising effectiveness. It discussed
    several methods, starting with quantization, which compresses models by reducing
    bit precision, thus shrinking model size and accelerating inference – a crucial
    phase where a model generates predictions. This involves a trade-off between model
    size and speed against accuracy, with tools such as quantization-aware training
    used to balance these aspects.

    weights from LLMs to make them leaner and faster, which is particularly beneficial

    to a smaller, simpler one (student), retaining performance while ensuring that
    the model is lightweight enough for real-time applications or deployment on mobile
