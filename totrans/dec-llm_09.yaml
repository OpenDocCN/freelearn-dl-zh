- en: Quantization is a model optimization technique that converts the precision of
    the numbers used in a model from higher precision formats, such as 32-bit floating-point,
    to lower precision formats, such as 8-bit integers. The main goals of quantization
    are to reduce the model size and to make it run faster during inference, which
    is the process of making predictions using the model.

    to represent the weights in their neural networks. Quantization reduces these
    to lower-precision formats, such as 16-bit, 8-bit, or even fewer bits. The reduction

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter on performance optimization for LLMs, advanced techniques were
    introduced to enhance efficiency without compromising effectiveness. It discussed
    several methods, starting with quantization, which compresses models by reducing
    bit precision, thus shrinking model size and accelerating inference – a crucial
    phase where a model generates predictions. This involves a trade-off between model
    size and speed against accuracy, with tools such as quantization-aware training
    used to balance these aspects.

- en: Pruning was another method discussed, focusing on eliminating less critical
    weights from LLMs to make them leaner and faster, which is particularly beneficial
    for devices with limited processing capabilities. Knowledge distillation was also
    covered, which involves transferring insights from a large, complex model (teacher)
    to a smaller, simpler one (student), retaining performance while ensuring that
    the model is lightweight enough for real-time applications or deployment on mobile
    devices.
