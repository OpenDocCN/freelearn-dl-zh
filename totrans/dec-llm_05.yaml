    or domains can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The **Low-Rank
    Adaptation** ( **LoRA** ) and **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning** ( **PEFT** )
    techniques address these challenges by reducing the number of parameters that
    need to be updated during fine-tuning, thus making the process more efficient
    and accessible. Let’s review them in detail.

    into the training process. Instead of updating all model parameters, LoRA modifies
    only a small subset, which significantly reduces the computational overhead. This
    approach is particularly beneficial when working with large models where updating
    all parameters would be infeasible due to resource constraints.
