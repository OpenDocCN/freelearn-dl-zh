    months as we are now entering the era of multimodality. In fact, ChatGPT can now
    not only generate images from natural language descriptions but also reason about
    multimodal data and solve complex queries. This multimodal thinking brings ChatGPT
    closer to the way our brains process the reality around them, which is mainly
    made of visual input.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In *Chapter 1*, while covering the latest trends and innovations, we introduced
    multimodality as a feature typical of large multimodal models (a subset of large
    foundation models), which consists of processing and generating different types
    of data, such as text, images, audio, and video.

    are both part of the realm of generative AI and feature a Transformer architecture.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs are trained on extensive textual data, enabling them to understand and
    generate human-like text. They are utilized in applications such as content creation,
    language translation, and customer service agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, LMMs expand upon LLMs by processing and integrating multiple
    data types, including text, images, audio, and video. This allows them to generate
    images from textual descriptions, analyze videos with textual context, and create
    content that combines various data forms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The added value of LMMs is that they can comprehensively reason about a heterogeneous
    surrounding environment, processing the latent semantics of circumstances rather
    than having siloed reasoning on each “reality asset” type. I’m aware this might
    sound too abstract, so let me give you an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you are sitting in a room, and you are aware of everything happening
    around you. You hear voices, see objects, and read a nice book. All these senses
    are different types of input coming to your brain. But your brain doesn’t separate
    them; it processes everything together, allowing you to understand your environment
    as a whole. For example, you might relate something you are reading in the book
    – let’s say, a nice landscape – to what you can see from your room’s window.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, think of an LMM as being like a person in this room. Instead of just understanding
    words (like reading a book), it can also “see” pictures (images), “hear” sounds
    (voices), and make correlations among them. All this information flows in at the
    same time, and the model combines it to make sense of the entire environment,
    just like how your brain blends everything together to help you understand what’s
    happening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, just like you can sit in a room and perceive it as a whole experience, an
    LMM can process different types of data all at once, whether it’s a picture, a
    piece of text, or an audio clip. It doesn’t treat these inputs separately but
    instead understands the full context of everything combined.

- en: In the previous chapters, we learned how well-written prompts are key when it
    comes to generating relevant results. This holds as much for generated text as
    for generated images. Henceforth, when we leverage models like DALL-E 3 (the latest
    version of the base model DALL-E), which receives natural language instructions
    as input and generates images as output, writing a well-designed prompt is paramount.

    to obtain the best result when invoking DALL-E 3.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designing prompts for DALL-E 3 is a creative process that involves carefully
    crafting descriptions to produce visually stunning and contextually appropriate
    images. Let’s explore some key techniques for designing prompts that yield the
    best results, from setting up a subject to adjusting technical details like aspect
    ratios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Defining the subject and setting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The subject is the core of any prompt. It’s the central object or concept that
    you want DALL-E 3 to visualize. The more specific and clear you are with your
    subject, the better DALL-E will be able to interpret and create an accurate image.
    For example, instead of just saying “a dog,” specify “a golden retriever puppy
    playing in a garden.” Adding elements such as the *setting* can further refine
    the image, like “playing in a garden filled with tulips during spring.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Example prompt**: “A golden retriever puppy playing in a tulip-filled garden
    during springtime.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    (the garden) and in what conditions (springtime), providing a clearer context
    for the generated image.

    and atmosphere of the image by controlling the **color palette** and **lighting
    conditions**. The tone of the image can change dramatically based on whether the
    scene is bright and vibrant or muted and calm. Colors can evoke specific emotions,
    while lighting conditions like soft sunlight, harsh midday light, or moody shadows
    can affect the overall feel of the image.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    used, can take your prompt from simple to sophisticated. By adding these details,
    you instruct DALL-E on how to render the image in a way that feels more intentional
    or artistic. You can specify the type of shot—whether it’s a close-up, a wide-angle
    view, or even a macro shot for intricate details.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another technique to improve prompt engineering is to borrow from established
    art styles or specific artists. By referencing a **particular artist** or **art
    movement**, you can imbue the image with distinct characteristics, such as the
    brush strokes of Van Gogh or the abstract shapes of Picasso. Alternatively, you
    can direct DALL-E to follow a broader artistic movement, like Impressionism, Surrealism,
    or Photorealism, depending on the style you want.

    meaning and influence the final image. Whether you’re creating something with
    a historical theme, like “medieval Europe,” or a futuristic vibe with “sci-fi
    city,” including these elements helps the AI model understand the time period,
    architecture, and style of the setting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in which the image is “created.” This could be anything from photography, painting,
    or even sculpture. Each medium has its own set of textures, forms, and visual
    rules, which DALL-E can emulate. Similarly, describing the **form** or **shape**
    of objects can guide the composition further.

    or even match a specific image format like widescreen or square, these choices
    finalize the aesthetic direction.

    it would be far more seamless to have them integrated with the software that we
    typically use for previous activities, like Photoshop for image editing or Canva
    for visuals.

    and building your own GPTs from the GPT store. We will cover GPTs in the next
    chapter, so I won’t dive deeply into what they are and how to create your own
    GPT from scratch; however, in the next section, I will show you some pre-built
    and publicly available GPTs that offer exactly this type of seamless integration
    with third-party services and that can boost your visual creativity.

    and customized versions of ChatGPT. Users can create their own GPT by specifying
    a system message, a set of actions, the tone, and other features that we are going
    to cover. Once you create your GPT, you can make it public via the GPT store,
    a nice marketplace that is available to all users with ChatGPT Plus.

    and, from there, navigate through many GPTs developed both by consumers and companies.
    In this section, we are going to cover some interesting GPTs developed by companies
    working in the visual design field and integrating generative AI via plugins (in
    GPT jargon, these plugins are called “actions.” We will cover this topic in the
    next chapter.).

    In fact, the real value of ChatGPT design and its visual capabilities (and of
    its capabilities in general) is unleashed when we can integrate them into our
    own tools and processes, unlocking a seamless productivity flow. As demonstrated
    in this chapter, this can be achieved through GPTs’ actions and, more broadly,
    with GPTs – a topic we will cover in more detail in the next chapter.
