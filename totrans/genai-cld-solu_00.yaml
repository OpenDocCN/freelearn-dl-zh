- en: Generative AI – the world has been buzzing about this profound concept recently.
    Everywhere you turn, whether you are watching the nightly news, listening to some
    of the brightest business leaders adopting technology, or following the global
    markets, generative AI is at the forefront of these conversations. This revolutionary
    technology is being interwoven with all industries, economies, businesses, and
    organizations at an unprecedented rate.

- en: While the concepts of both artificial intelligence and, more recently, generative
    AI have been around for quite some time, both entered mainstream knowledge with
    the introduction of an extremely powerful conversational chatbot, known as ChatGPT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT, introduced in late 2022, interacts with a user or application in a
    conversational way at a level and precision society has not seen before. We have
    had chatbots for a very long time, however, ChatGPT broke the mold and essentially
    catapulted humanity into the “age of AI.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technology behind ChatGPT, and thus generative AI, which we will cover in
    this book, makes it possible to accomplish profound things never seen before –
    such as answering follow-up questions, admitting its mistakes, challenging incorrect
    thoughts and suggestions, and even rejecting inappropriate requests, to help protect
    us. ChatGPT has grabbed the attention of everyone – even those not in the technology
    industry – due to its powerful knowledge capabilities and speed and precision
    in responses.

    knowing it. And this growth trend will not slow down any time soon. In fact, we
    expect almost all future careers and jobs to have a basic requirement of core
    experience/expertise with, *plus* working knowledge of, some AI, and with a bonus
    skill of AI/GenAI implementation. This book will serve as your fundamental guide
    to prepare you for today and for tomorrow.

    AI and subsequently what it takes to build a successful cloud solution around
    this AI technology. We’ll use the Microsoft Azure AI Cloud and OpenAI lens for
    our examples, due to both market leadership and also because we are both currently
    employed at Microsoft. We do take a holistic, industry-wide approach where the
    knowledge and concepts can be applied across any cloud solution provider/vendor.

    we cover, generative AI (with the exception of the fun, generated comic strips

    AI and its integration with cloud computing. This is followed by an exploration
    of the model layer, diving deeper into the intricacies of **Large Language Models**
    (**LLMs**), including the evolution of **Natural Language Processing** (**NLP**)
    and the advent of transformer models. It discusses techniques such as fine-tuning
    and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (**RAG**) for augmenting model knowledge.
    The book then discusses prompt engineering methods. Moving on to the application
    level, it covers the development framework and strategies, emphasizing scaling,
    security, safety, and compliance with responsible AI principles. The concluding
    section provides foresight into the future trajectory of generative AI. Here is
