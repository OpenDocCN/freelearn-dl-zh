I need you to create a set of detailed instructions from this document. As the user performs each step, reach out to the appropriate service to verify completion and provide the status of each step. Follow these guidelines:\n1\\. Format the instructions as a numbered list.\n2\\. Each step should be clear and concise, with no more than two sentences per step.\n3\\. Use formal language suitable for interacting with a new professional.\n4\\. Focus on key actions new employees must take and omit any unnecessary background information.\n5\\. The instructions should be easy to follow for someone new to the company.\n6\\. Do not ask the new employee to remember information. Provide details at each step and confirm any understanding of those steps as you proceed through the process.\n7\\. If there are errors, report them in clear, simple terms and explain how to fix them. If a step doesn't block progress, keep track of it so the user can complete it in any order.\n8\\. Keep it short and simple for questions that have well-known answers, like Age or Height. For less well-known questions, provide an example or details about what is needed.\nFor example:\n1.**Sign into the company portal**: Use your assigned credentials from the welcome email to access the portal.\n2\\. **Complete the onboarding form**: Fill out all required fields, including your personal and emergency contact information.
