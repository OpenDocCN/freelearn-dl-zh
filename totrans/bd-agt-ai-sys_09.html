    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">
     When these vulnerabilities extend to agentic systems, the risks become even more pronounced as these systems not only generate responses but also execute actions based on their understanding.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">
     An adversarial attack on an agentic system could potentially manipulate its decision-making process, causing it to take harmful actions or make dangerous choices autonomously.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">
     For instance, an agentic system managing supply chain operations could be tricked into making catastrophic inventory decisions, or a trading agent could be manipulated into executing harmful

     An adversarial attack on such a system could potentially lead to disastrous consequences.

     The issue of bias in AI systems has been a long-standing concern, and both generative AI models and the agentic systems built upon them are susceptible to this challenge.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">
     These models learn from their training data, and if that data contains biases or reflects societal prejudices, the AI will inevitably absorb and perpetuate those biases not just in its outputs but in its decision-making processes and

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">
     If biased, such a system could systematically discriminate against certain demographic groups throughout the entire employment life cycle, from initial screening to promotion decisions.
