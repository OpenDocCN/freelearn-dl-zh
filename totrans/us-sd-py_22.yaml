    player Lee Sedol in a five-game match. This was a significant event because Go
    is a game that requires strategic thinking and intuition and it has been considered
    impossible for computers to master due to its complexity. AlphaGo’s victory was
    a testament to the advancements in AI and machine learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AlphaGo’s success was based on a combination of deep neural networks and Monte
    Carlo tree search techniques. It was trained on thousands of professional Go games
    to learn patterns and strategies. Then, it played many games against itself to
    improve its skills and understanding of the game.

    However, the model that powers AlphaGo is not short of limitations. Here are a

    Go. It doesn’t have the ability to transfer its knowledge to other games or domains.
    If we added one more row to the game board, AlphaGo would not be able to function
    as it should.'

- en: AlphaGo was trained only with GoPlay data, so its data scope is quite limited,
    which is the root cause of its “specification” feature. It is similar to **Convolution
    Neural Network** (**CNN**)-based image classification models. These models are
    trained by a set of predefined data; hence, they can only be performed on the
    scoped input data.

- en: In 2017, the paper “*Attention Is All You Need*” [2] introduced the transformer
    model. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the transformer model in
    a specific unsupervised task called machine translation. They trained the model
    to translate sentences from one language to another without any aligned sentence
    pairs or explicit supervision. Instead, they used an encoder-decoder structure
    to predict the next word with probability. In other words, the next “word” or
    “token” is the training label for the input, so the model tries to learn patterns
    or structures present in data without any explicit guidance about what to learn.
  prefs: []

    of writing). But the idea and the implementation of training a model without predefined
    labels is genius.

    GPT-3 uses a decoder-only architecture to generate text. Some other visual models
    use an attention mechanism to replace the CNN structure – for example, a **Vision
    Transformer** (**ViT**) [3] and the **Swin** **transformer** [4].

    Stable Diffusion can take any image and captioned pair for training, without a
    limitation in its data scope. If we have enough hardware power, we can provide
    all images of the world and their associated description text to train a super

    there will be no need to learn programming or math, as we can delegate any tasks
    to AI. However, this is far from the truth. This wave of AI revolution opens a

    probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra, which are essential for AI
    algorithms. For example, the latent-based diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) is
    an algorithm based on neural networks, which are inspired by the structure of
    the human brain. The most important part of deep learning is backpropagation,
    which is essentially calculus. Therefore, AI cannot exist without mathematics.
