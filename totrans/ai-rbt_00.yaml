- en: The definition of a robot is a machine that can do human-like tasks. In order
    to perform these tasks, a robot must be able to see, understand, and interact
    with the environment. AI is the quickest way to recognize objects and navigate.
    This book empowers you with the essential skills to efficiently operate your robots
    using AI techniques such as **Convolutional Neural Networks** (**CNNs**), computer
    vision, object recognition, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning.

- en: So, who is writing this book? As you can see from my biography, I’ve been doing
    this for over 40 years, starting as a 12-year-old kid doing science fair projects,
    then as an Air Force enlisted person, an entry level engineer at NASA, and so
    on. I started doing AI in 1992 and specialized in machine decision making. Today,
    I design complete flying autonomous vehicles that weigh tens of thousands of pounds.
    I’m pleased to be putting some of that experience down on paper to share with
    you.

- en: 'Why did I write this book? I felt that there was a gap in the available literature
    for someone coming up in the robotics and autonomy world who needs to move in
    capability from the hobbyist to the beginnings of industrial and commercial robotics.
    In doing this, I want to remove as many of what I perceive as barriers between
    you and what you want to accomplish as a next-level robotics explorer. I left
    out the equations, the strange jargon, and the mystery and replaced them with
    straightforward explanations about how to get what you want out of your robot.
    It is important to remember that my robot, Albert, is just a tool in this process.
    The objective of the book is not to design a singular robot, but rather to teach
    a set of skills that I think you need. The real question is where you go from
    here. Use this text as a springboard to continue to explore, experiment, and continue
    your education in robotics. From here you can read the works of the people who
    inspired and/or mentored me: Dr. Robin Murphy, Sebastian Thrun, Dr. Rodney Brooks,
    Bob Zubrin, Dr. Robert L. Forward, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and many others.'

- en: This book is for robotics engineers and enthusiasts who have already begun their
    journey of learning about robotics and wish to progress to a more advanced stage
    of capability by applying AI. It will be a useful reference for students and researchers
    looking for a practical guide to solving specific problems or approaching a difficult
    robot design. Basic programming skills in Python, a familiarity with electronics
    and wiring, and the ability to use a Linux-based **command line interface** (**CLI**)
    will be useful while reading this book.

- en: You should have a good grasp of programming with Python version 3\. We use ROS
    2 as the control architecture for the robot. Packt Publishing has several excellent
    books that explain how to use ROS 2 if you need more detailed instruction. Programming
    skills in Python, familiarity with electronics, wiring, and single-board computers,
    the ability to use a Linux-based CLI, and knowledge of AI/ML concepts will be
    required while using this book. If you want to follow the robot’s construction,
    then basic hand tools (screwdrivers, wrenches, Allen keys, and a soldering iron)
    will be required. All the other installation instructions are provided in the
    appropriate chapters as the book progresses.

    Intelligence** (**AI**), covering what AI is and how it is used. Then we start
    to define our robot systems and talk about control. In the second chapter, we
    look at robot anatomy, the parts of a robot, and discuss autonomy principles and
    the Subsumption Architecture concept. You'll get a primer on the **Robotics Operating
    System** (**ROS**) and our single-board supercomputer. Finally, we show a systematic
    process for robot design using systems engineering principles and storyboards.
