    also images, video, and music.

    AI to its greatest popularity: OpenAI. Founded in 2015, OpenAI mainly focuses
    its research on a particular type of generative model, **Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer** (**GPT**). Then, in November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a free
    web app of a conversational assistant powered by GPT models. It gained immense

    as in various industry domains, is huge. We also saw, in *Chapter 3*, how to properly
    design the most important element when using generative models such as ChatGPT:
    the prompt. Prompts are the user’s input, nothing more than instructions in natural
    language. Designing prompts is a pivotal step to getting the maximum value from
    your generative models to the point where **prompt engineering** has become a
    new domain of study.'

    generative power of ChatGPT.

    can boost not only daily productivity but also domain-specific activities – for
    developers, from code generation and optimization to interpreting machine learning
    models; in the case of marketers, from new product development to improving **search
    engine optimization** (**SEO**); for researchers, from experiment design to the
    generation of a presentation based on a study; and for those needing an assistant
    for visual creativity, from design suggestions to images and canvas creation.

    (code generation, marketing research, and so on) can be further tailored by building
    highly specialized assistants called GPTs, leveraging OpenAI’s GPT Store. With
    GPTs, users can build personal assistants that leverage the power of the model
    behind ChatGPT, yet benefit from a more specialized and scoped behavior, leveraging
    knowledge bases, plugins, and precise instructions provided by users themselves
    – all without writing a single line of code!

    However, it is important to acknowledge that our choice of the “best LLM for our
    app” shouldn’t be routed toward the biggest (on average) highest-performing model
    available. As of the time of writing, there are many LLMs that have been trained
    in a specific domain or expertise (like mathematical reasoning, code generation,
    specific languages, and so on) that, on average, perform way worse than general-purpose
    models like OpenAI’s o1\. Nevertheless, we might consider different variables
    when it comes to developing our application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of an industry-specific taxonomy. If this is the case, we might want to leverage
    LLMs that have been trained and fine-tuned for this purpose, like Microsoft’s
    BioGPT. Or, we might need to run our model locally, in disconnected scenarios
    (think about an offshore plant in the middle of the ocean); if this is the case,
    we couldn’t run, let’s say, GPT-4o – firstly, because it is a proprietary model
    and cannot be “downloaded”; secondly, would we have a supercomputer that is capable
    of hosting more than 100 trillion parameters?
