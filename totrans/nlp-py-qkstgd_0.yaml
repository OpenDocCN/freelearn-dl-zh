- en: '**Natural language processing** (**NLP**) is the use of machines to manipulate
    natural language. This book teaches you how to build NLP applications with code
    and relevant case studies using Python. This book will introduce you to the basic
    vocabulary and a suggested workflow for building NLP applications to help you
    get started with popular NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition,
    part of speech tagging, stemming, and word embeddings.'

    discusses some of the most common text pre-processing ideas. You will be introduced
    to spaCy and will learn how to use it for tokenization, sentence extraction, and
    lemmatization.'

    goes into a simple use case and examines how we can solve it. Then, we repeat
    this task again, but on a slightly different text corpus.'

    â€“ Words to Numbers*, introduces readers to the Gensim API. We will also learn
    to load pre-trained GloVe vectors and to use these vector representations instead
    of TD-IDF in any machine learning model.'

    Classification*, looks at several new ideas regarding machine learning. The intention
    here is to demonstrate some of the most common classifiers. We will also learn
    about concepts such as sentiment analysis, simple classifiers, and how to optimize
    them for your datasets and ensemble methods.'

    the key ideas in any deep learning model. We will also look at a few topics regarding
    PyTorch, how to tokenize text, and what recurrent networks are.'
