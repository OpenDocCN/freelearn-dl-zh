- en: '*Learn Robotics Programming* is about building and programming a robot with
    smart behavior. It covers the skills required to make and build a gadget from
    parts, including how to choose them. These parts include sensors, motors, cameras,
    microphones, speakers, lights, and a Raspberry Pi.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book continues with how to write code to make those parts do something
    interesting. The book uses Python, together with a little bit of HTML/CSS and
    JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technology used is intended to include things that are available and affordable
    and the code is shown to demonstrate concepts, so they can be used and combined
    to create even more interesting code and robots.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The topics combine aspects of being a programmer with aspects of being a robot
    maker, with a number of specialist topics such as computer vision and voice assistants
    thrown in.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for someone with a little programming experience, or someone
    more experienced but looking to apply their skills to a hardware project. You
    do not need to be an expert-level programmer, but do have to have written some
    lines of code and be comfortable with looping, conditionals, and functions. Knowledge
    of object-oriented- (class- and object-) based programming isn't necessary but
    is introduced in the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book does not require a specialist workshop, although there will be a little
    soldering and bolting things together. This will be introduced later in the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do not need to have any experience at all with electronics or making things,
    but hopefully, you'll have a healthy interest in learning more, since some very
    basic concepts are introduced throughout the book. Being keen to build a robot,
    get it to do stuff, and find out what to do with it next is probably the most
    important aspect of the book.
