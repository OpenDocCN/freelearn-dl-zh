- en: Deepfakes have a reputation for being extremely dangerous and of questionable
    ethics. While any technology can be abused, it is the usage itself that is unethical,
    not the technology itself. This applies to deepfakes as well. As long as the usage
    is ethical, deepfakes can be an ethical technology. However, there are still potential
    threats from deepfakes. The technology is available publicly – anyone can make
    a deepfake, even those with unethical intentions. The best way to limit the danger
    of deepfakes may well be to make sure that everyone knows about them, effectively
    inoculating the public against trusting a video just because they have watched
    it.

- en: Deepfakes began with an unfortunately unethical beginning. The first public
    deepfakes were created by a Reddit user by the name of /u/Deepfakes. These first
    videos showing off Deepfake’s capabilities involved putting (usually) female actors
    into pornographic scenes. This non-consensual pornography was radically different
    from previous fakes in that they were more realistic, easier to create, and full
    video, capable of poses and expressions that the target actor had never performed
    in any recorded media.

  zh: 深度伪造始于一个不幸的不道德起点。第一个公开的深度伪造是由一个名叫/u/Deepfakes的Reddit用户创造的。这些展示深度伪造能力的第一批视频通常涉及将（通常是）女演员放入色情场景中。这种未经同意的色情内容与之前的伪造截然不同，因为它们更加逼真，更容易创建，而且是全视频，能够呈现目标演员从未在任何记录媒体中表演过的姿势和表情。
- en: Non-consensual pornographic deepfakes are not victimless events. This usage
    is extremely damaging as it harms the actors in profound ways. With non-consensual
    deepfakes being made, celebrities are losing control of their image and reputation.
    Unfortunately, there is no way to completely avoid the threat from deepfakes as
    even after proving a video isn’t actually of them, the deepfake will still be
    spread and objectify the actor. Some of the people being deepfaked in pornographic
    films against their will aren’t even celebrities and aren’t equipped or ready
    to deal with the attention and infamy of the situation.

    despite the lack of consent, as they were done in parody and without violating

    with the content. This includes whether they’re comfortable with nudity or sexuality
    in their roles. Even though they may have done some similar scenes in the past,
    they may change their mind if the work, context, or even opinions change. When
    a person who has chosen not to be in sexual roles gets deepfaked into pornographic
    scenes, their decisions are dismissed and violated. Actors who have participated
    in sexual scenes in the past were able to make that decision in the context of
    the work; that does not mean that they aren’t harmed when put into other scenes
    in different contexts or put into scenes that perhaps they would no longer choose
    to participate in.

- en: In the case of deepfake Tom Cruise by Chris Ume, and similar works, they stay
    on the positive side of this rule by showing nothing outrageous or disrespectful.
    The things that deepfake Tom Cruise does are not outside the realm of what Tom

- en: This doesn’t mean that your work can’t be used unethically. For example, if
    it’s taken out of context and shared on social media, it could spread far and
    wide without the warning that it’s a deepfake. To combat this, the warning that
    it’s a deepfake may need to be more than a disclaimer at the beginning or description.
    Try to think of how it could be misused and present the warning in a way that
    matches the risk.

  zh: 这并不意味着你的作品不能被不道德地使用。例如，如果它被脱离上下文并在社交媒体上分享，它可能会在没有警告它是深度伪造的情况下广泛传播。为了应对这种情况，关于它是深度伪造的警告可能需要比开头的免责声明或描述更多。试着想想它可能被如何滥用，并以与风险相匹配的方式呈现警告。
- en: If the risk of it being misused is low, then no explicit warning may be needed,
    instead simply allowing the absurdity of the situation or the innocuous nature
    of the deepfake to disarm the risk. This, for example, is the case with the large
    number of videos that have the actor Nicolas Cage swapped into them. It’s easy
    to see that Cage wasn’t the original actor (especially when a deepfake swapped
    Nicolas Cage onto Amy Adams in *Man of Steel*) and, even when it’s not, the danger
    is low of any real damage ensuing.

  zh: 如果被滥用的风险很低，那么可能不需要明确的警告，而是简单地允许情况的荒谬性或深度伪造的无害性质消除风险。例如，大量将演员尼古拉斯·凯奇（Nicolas
    Cage）替换进视频中的情况就是这样。很容易看出凯奇不是原始演员（尤其是当深度伪造将尼古拉斯·凯奇换到《钢铁侠》中的艾米·亚当斯身上时），即使没有，任何真实损害的风险也很低。
- en: Another clear example is when your deepfake is used where special effects or
    visual effects are commonplace. If you’re bringing a deceased actor into a movie
    where visual effects would be expected, there is little reason to explicitly label
    the content as a deepfake. The context alone is sufficient to make it clear that
    you cannot trust everything you see. The famous story of the radio drama of H.G.
    Wells’s *War of the Worlds* causing panic in the street is unlikely to happen
    with a deepfake bringing an actor back to life for a movie they couldn’t film.

  zh: 另一个明显的例子是，当你的深度伪造被用于特效或视觉特效普遍存在的地方。如果你在电影中引入已故演员，而那里预期会有特效，那么明确标注内容为深度伪造就没有太多必要。仅凭上下文本身就足以清楚地表明，你不能相信你所看到的一切。H.G.威尔斯的广播剧《世界大战》在街头引起恐慌的著名故事，不太可能发生在深度伪造使演员在电影中复活的情况下。

    harm to a person’s future. Even if the damage is only temporary or limited, having
    the threat of actions you didn’t actually do causing similar harm is a scary proposition.

    A politician, in many ways, relies on their reputation in order to get elected.

    are many who would believe the results even if they were revealed to be a fabrication.
    This is the unfortunate nature of human psychology where we are far more likely
    to believe something that confirms our already-held beliefs than something that
    disproves them. Once an opinion is made of a candidate in the minds of the public,
    there is little that can be done to reverse that opinion, especially bringing

    when Barrack Obama invited Keegan Michael Key to be his “anger translator” at
