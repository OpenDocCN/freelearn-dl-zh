    various forms of content, including but not limited to text, images, audio, and
    video. These AI systems can generate new content, based on their training data
    and input parameters, which usually include text prompts but can also involve
    other forms of input such as images. The recent buzz around generative AI comes
    from the simplicity with which new user interfaces powered by this AI technology
    can create high-quality text, graphics, and videos in seconds.

    the data from which it has been trained. In other words, learning the underlying
    patterns, structures, and distributions of input data enables a procedure within
    the model allowing it to generate new data in a similar way. For instance, if
    trained on a dataset of human faces, a generative AI model will be able to create
    completely new faces of people that don’t actually exist in real life but are
    very realistic. In essence, generative AI models work by learning the probability
    distribution of a dataset and then sampling from that distribution to create new
    instances. This approach is different from discriminative models, whose goal is
    to learn how to tell classes of data apart. For example, a discriminative model
    could be trained to separate pictures of cats and dogs, but a generative model
    would be trained to make up completely new pictures of cats or dogs.

    the time when machine learning was in its cradle. However, it is only recently
    that this field has come under the limelight due to neural networks and drastic
    improvements in computing power over the last 10 years. In the early attempts
    at generative modeling—Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models—many simpler
    statistical techniques were involved. Methods of modeling arbitrary complex data
    distributions have much higher potential compatibility with the kinds of methods
    that were previously dominant but have recently been overcome by deep learning.
    Deep learning was therefore a watershed development for the field of generative
    AI. Models, such as VAEs, which started appearing around the beginning of the
    2010s, were able to leverage deep neural networks to model more complex data distributions.
    Around that same period, GANs were proposed; for the first time, they offered
    a new way for two neural networks to work together to create data, using principles
    from game theory. In a general sense, these breakthroughs took leaps toward the
    possibilities of making real, high-quality, realistic creation of data.

    with the conception of new and innovative content. It opens ways for new routes
    of drug discovery and personalized medicine in health. In the business world,
    generative AI works by providing efficient and effective customer engagement through
    personalized content and experiences. The other point involves questioning one’s
    own stance regarding creativity and originality: when machines are able to pump
    out very similar material, one is automatically forced to think about what creativity
    is, who the artist really is, and what the ethical parameters should be for AI-created
    content.'

    VAE consists of learning a probabilistic mapping between data and a latent space,
    and vice versa. This means learning how to convert real data into a simplified
    representation (such as a compressed form) and then back again into data that
    looks real. VAEs are designed to ensure a high likelihood of the data while preserving
    a well-structured latent space to enable the generation of new data samples similar
    to the training data. Some of the most common flavors of VAE are as follows:'

- en: '**VAE** : The basic model that compresses and reconstructs data. It gives a
    framework for generating new samples out of the learned latent space. The VAE
    is a generative model that learns to compress and reconstruct data while also
    learning a probability distribution of the latent space. In simpler terms, a VAE
    is like a clever algorithm that learns to understand and recreate data. Imagine
    it as a skilled artist who can compress a detailed painting into a simple sketch
    (encoding) and then recreate the full painting from that sketch (decoding). What
    makes VAEs special is that they don’t just copy data but also learn the essence
    of it, allowing them to create new, similar data. This is like an artist learning
    not just to copy specific paintings but also to understand the style so well that
    they can paint new, original works in that style. In real life, VAEs have been
    used in many creative ways. For instance, in drug discovery, VAEs have been used
    to generate novel molecular structures. Researchers at AstraZeneca used VAEs to
    explore chemical space and propose new drug-like molecules with desired properties,
    potentially accelerating the drug development process [1].'

    explicitly the trade-off between the reconstruction quality and the disentanglement
    of the latent space. The model undertakes the creation of more interpretable disentangled
    representations. In simpler terms, Beta-VAE is like a more flexible version of
    the original VAE. It allows researchers to adjust how much the model focuses on
    recreating exact details versus understanding the underlying features of the data.
    This is similar to teaching an art student to not just copy a painting but also
    to understand and separate the key elements such as color, shape, and style. This
    ability to *disentangle* features makes Beta-VAE particularly useful in fields
    such as computer vision and robotics. For example, researchers have used Beta-VAE
    to teach robots to understand objects better. By learning to separate features
    such as size, color, and position, robots can more easily recognize and manipulate
    objects in different situations, making them more adaptable and efficient in various
    tasks [2].'

    the generation process on some extra information, typically class labels, producing
    not just data similar to the training set but also samples that can then be drawn
    from specific classes . Think of CVAE as a more controlled version of VAE, like
    an artist who can paint in different styles on demand. Instead of just creating
    random new paintings, this artist can be told to “ *Paint a landscape* ” or “
    *Paint a portrait* ” and they’ll create new art in that specific category. This
    added control makes CVAE very useful in practical applications. For instance,
    in the field of computer games, CVAE has been used for game development and procedural
    content generation with the generation of game elements such as character design,
    level layouts, music and sound effects, and so on. By providing different conditions
    such as “ *Create a forest level* ” or “ *Create a desert level* ,” the CVAE can
    produce a wide variety of game environments, saving time for designers and enhancing
    the player’s experience with more diverse and interesting game worlds [3].'

    artist (generator) and critic (discriminator) in a GAN a better way to communicate
    and evaluate each other’s work. Instead of just saying “ *good* ” or “ *bad* ,”
    they can now give more nuanced feedback, such as “ *You’re getting warmer* ” or
    “ *You’re way off* .” This leads to more consistent improvement and high-quality
    results. In practical applications, WGANs have been used in medical imaging to
    generate synthetic medical images for training purposes. This helps in creating
    larger, more diverse datasets for training diagnostic AI systems, potentially

    a number of things that are happening in the background. Firstly, the customer
    starts with a vague request to book a flight. The AI assistant understands that
    in order to proceed with this request, it needs a few more pieces of information
    to look up available flights, such as departure/arrival city, dates of travel,
    and so on.

    information to be able to successfully complete the booking. The information it
    gathers at each step is used as a parameter value to call flight booking-related
    APIs in the backend; for example, city/travel dates/number of passengers are required
    to look up available flight information using a (fictitious) API named **flightLookup**
    , customer name/phone/email are required to actually make the booking using an
    API named b **ookFlight** , and so on. *Figure 1* *.2* gives an overview of the

    bit of introspection, also known as **chain of thought** ( **CoT** ), at the beginning
    of the conversation. This means the model in the backend crafts a step-by-step
    approach to complete the task but identifies some missing information. It then
    responds back to the customer with a request to provide the required information.
    Subsequently, based on the input from the customer, it makes certain decisions
    autonomously to call specific tools using the agent and completes the task.

    of these components in detail in the subsequent chapters. For now, it is sufficient
    to know that agents are an advanced application of LLMs (such as this travel booking
    AI assistant) and represent an emerging field that combines aspects of various
    LLM types with additional AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, planning,
    and tool use. As you learn more in subsequent chapters, you will notice that agents
    are designed to be more interactive, adaptable, and capable of completing complex,
    multi-step tasks compared to standard LLMs, which makes them suitable for a variety
    of different complex tasks and workflows.

    As discussed earlier, industries such as healthcare, finance, education, media

    to benefit from generative AI capabilities. The following is a survey of only
    a few of the primary applications of generative AI:'

- en: '**Generation of images and videos** : Multimodal generative models (that is,
    LLMs that can handle images, text, audio, and videos) are making it possible to
    generate realistic audio/visuals through various platforms and tools. For example,
    in media and entertainment, generative AI can help in generating visual effects,
    designing avatars, and developing virtual reality content. In the fashion and
    design industry, it is being used to conceptualize new clothing designs, prepare
    virtual fashion shows, and make fashion trend predictions. In marketing ads and
    promotion space, generative AI is being used to generate tailor-made advertisements,
    campaigns, marketing communications, and other marketing materials creatives such
    as images and logos.'

    when it comes to text-based tasks. For instance, content writing such as rapid
    and hassle-free generation of articles, blog posts, marketing, and product copies
    are already some of the most common use cases. Chatbots and virtual assistants
    are providing customer support in a very humanlike manner to information-related
    inquiries. Generative AI is also assisting in text translation, document summarization,
    and content localization for increased accessibility of content for platforms
    such as online learning and specialized search engines.'

    developers in software development. These models can often generate accurate code
    snippets, or sometimes an entire function based on text prompts. Advanced implementation
    of generative AI in code generation includes plugins created for various **integrated
    development environments** ( **IDEs** ), such as **Visual Studio Code** ( **VS
    Code** ), that can understand the entire context of the code base, identify errors,
    create code documentation, and generate unit test scripts. Another implementation
    of code generation is text-to-query use cases where a natural language prompt
    is converted into a SQL query, which can then be executed against a database to
    get the desired results. However, this is one of the areas where special caution
    must be taken, especially before executing the code generated by an LLM, to prevent
    risks of malicious code execution. Often, in these situations, the code generated
    by the LLM is executed in a sandbox and sanitized to check whether the code is
    safe and appropriate for execution in an autonomous environment.'

- en: '**Autonomous workflows and robotics** : As we briefly discussed earlier, LLM-powered
    AI agents are an advanced implementation of generative AI with LLMs serving as
    their foundations. These agents can perform several tasks in various use cases.
    For example, a travel booking website with a virtual assistant chatbot can implement
    agents to automate the travel and hotel booking process for the customer. In these
    cases, the agent-based system can act on specific tasks using tools (such as calling
    a flight booking API) simply by understanding the context of the conversation
    that the customer is having with the chatbot. More advanced agent-based systems
    often come into play when discussing robotics, where a robot’s actions are primarily
    controlled by agents. The robotic agent essentially determines what decisions
    to make based on its environment or the specific task it is assigned to perform.
    It uses agents to execute actions that an LLM would otherwise be unable to perform;
    for example, an agent can turn on or off the limb actuators of a robot. AI in
    robotics is a novel and open field of research, with numerous innovations emerging
    in the industry, particularly targeted toward manufacturing applications.'

    in the training dataset. Any model trained with biased or unrepresentative data
    will reproduce outputs with the same kind of bias, hence solidifying existing
    biases or allowing marginalization of one or several groups in case of bias in
    the training data.
  id: totrans-167

    good quality data, and so on for a wide array of perspectives within the dataset
    itself used for training. As with any machine learning problem, analysis of the
    data and knowing the data distribution across features is often helpful. Data
    analysis can reveal imbalances that can introduce bias in the model. There are
    several algorithmic ways of mitigating bias in training data (for instance, using
    oversampling or undersampling), but each of these methods has its own advantages
    and disadvantages. For example, consider two classes of data in a training dataset
    that contains more instances of *Class 0* data than *Class 1* data, causing a
    natural imbalance in the dataset. When a model is trained with such a dataset,
    the model would “overfit” on the *Class 0* type of data and would become more
    proficient in or even memorize data that belongs to *Class 0* and may not perform
    well for data belonging to *Class 1* This inherently causes the model to perform
    poorly and demonstrate heavy bias. The following figure demonstrates the effect
    of oversampling and undersampling on such a dataset to mitigate bias:'

- en: Multiple experiments and researchers have proven that LLMs have a propensity
    to leak data they are trained on. This is especially problematic if the models
    are trained on large amounts of private or proprietary information. Special techniques
    and styles of prompting LLMs have shown that it is sufficient to coerce the model
    to generate data that includes verbatim text from its training dataset. These
    prompting techniques are not sophisticated and often make it a very easy, cost-effective
    attack vector to get a model to leak information. For example, as discussed in
    the paper named *Scalable Extraction of Training Data from (Production) Language
    Models* [15], researchers were able to spend only $200 worth of API calls to OpenAI’s
    GPT-3.5 model and use prompt injection techniques to coerce the model to leak
    private information. The leaked information includes people’s names, email and
    physical addresses, and phone numbers that were inadvertently present in the model’s
    training dataset. While some of these issues are actively being addressed by model
    providers such as OpenAI, it can still be problematic for organizations that choose
    to train their own models in-house.

- en: Some of the common mechanisms to mitigate this is to perform data anonymization
    or pseudonymization on the training data to remove or obscure personal, private,
    and or proprietary information, even before training the model. Both of these
    techniques involved using smaller, cheaper, and faster AI models to perform classification
    and entity detection to identify the presence of personal or private data in the
    training dataset. Once identified, the private information can be obscured, masked,
    or entirely removed from the training dataset. Note that there could be several
    implications to doing this depending on your use case, so special analysis must
    be performed to ensure that it doesn’t impact the model’s performance.

- en: Training sophisticated generative models is very resource-intensive and requires
    high computational power; this often makes it economically cost-prohibitive and
    energy-consuming to train large language models. Although there have been several
    hardware breakthroughs that make it possible to train such models, access to these
    hardware assets still remains expensive, privileged, and limited. For example,
    **graphics processing units** ( **GPUs** ), initially designed for rendering high-fidelity
    graphics, have become crucial for AI model training, fine-tuning, and computations.
    NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture, introduced in 2006, allowed GPUs to be used for general-purpose
    computing, and modern GPUs such as NVIDIA’s A100 and H100 have since been specifically
    optimized for AI workloads. However, these high-end GPUs can often cost tens of
    thousands of dollars per unit.

- en: Training large models such as GPT-3 is estimated to cost millions of dollars
    in compute resources alone. The exact cost depends on factors such as model size,
    training duration, and hardware efficiency. For example, training GPT-3 was estimated
    to cost around $4–5 million in compute resources, and more recent models such
    as GPT-4 and PaLM are likely even more expensive to train. Beyond the hardware
    itself, there are significant infrastructure costs related to power consumption,
    cooling, and data center space. Due to the high costs, training large language
    models is primarily done by large tech companies or well-funded research institutions.
    Cloud services now offer access to pre-trained models and fine-tuning capabilities,
    making some level of LLM work more accessible to smaller organizations and the
    general public. A way to overcome this challenge can be found in recent innovations
    with **small language models** ( **SLMs** ), which are much smaller generative
    AI models that can be trained to achieve specific tasks. Even though these models
    are limited to a very narrow set of domain-specific tasks, it is much more economical
    to train these models since they require far fewer computational resources.
