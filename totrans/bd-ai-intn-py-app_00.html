			<p><em class="italic">Building AI Intensive Python Applications</em> is a comprehensive guide to developing intelligent applications using Python. It explores the synergy between <strong class="bold">large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) and vector databases, two cutting-edge technologies that power innovative AI solutions. By mastering these tools, you’ll be equipped to design, implement, and optimize complex AI applications.</p>
			<p>This book is a thorough exploration of <strong class="bold">generative AI</strong> (<strong class="bold">GenAI</strong>), detailing the theoretical concepts and core components of intelligent applications. With code snippets, real-world use cases, and expert tips, this book provides practical guidance on designing AI/ML applications using Python. The strategies for evaluating, refining, and optimizing AI solutions covered in this book can help developers create robust and accurate AI applications that meet real-world demands.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for software engineers and developers looking to build intelligent applications using GenAI. While suitable for beginners, a basic understanding of Python programming is required. Working knowledge of MongoDB and OpenAI LLMs is preferred but not necessary. This book provides a step-by-step approach to building AI applications, making it suitable for both novices and experienced practitioners.</p>
