    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">
     Unlike RNNs, which process input data sequentially and may struggle with long-range dependencies in text, transformers employ a mechanism that allows them to weigh the importance—or “attention”—of different parts of the input data, regardless of their position.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">
     This means that transformers can effectively understand the context and nuanced relationships within a sentence or across multiple sentences, which is vital for tasks such as translation, question-answering,

   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">
     The model’s ability to predict each part of the output sequence is greatly enhanced by the attention mechanism—a core feature of transformers—enabling it to focus on different sections of the input sequence.

    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">
     When an LLM generates a response, it is essentially calculating the probability of a sequence of words given its training data and the input it has received.

     Data privacy emerges as a critical concern because, to achieve their advanced level of understanding and generation of human language, LLMs require training on vast datasets.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">
     These datasets typically contain information gleaned from a wide array of sources, including texts that may contain personal information.

     Beyond privacy, the issue of bias in LLMs is of paramount importance.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">
     These models learn to make predictions based on the data they are fed; if this data contains biases—whether related to gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status—the model is likely to replicate and potentially amplify these biases in its outputs.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">
     This can have serious implications, leading to discriminatory practices and reinforcing societal inequalities.
    </span>

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">
     When an LLM’s decision has a significant impact on a person’s life, such as in legal sentencing, loan approval, or job application screening, the ability to trace and understand the decision process is vital.
