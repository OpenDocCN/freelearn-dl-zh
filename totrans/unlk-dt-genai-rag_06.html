			<p><st c="33">In almost all cases, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="55">retrieval-augmented generation</st></strong><st c="85"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="87">RAG</st></strong><st c="90">) development involves the creation of one or more applications, or </st><em class="italic"><st c="159">apps</st></em><st c="163"> for short. </st><st c="175">When coding RAG apps initially, you will often create a variable in your code that represents a prompt or some other type of input that in turn represents what the RAG pipeline will work off of. </st><st c="370">But is that how future users will use the app you are building? </st><st c="434">How do you test this with these users using your code? </st><st c="489">You need </st><st c="498">an interface!</st></p>
			<p><st c="511">In this chapter, we will provide a practical guide to making your application interactive with RAG using </st><strong class="bold"><st c="617">Gradio</st></strong><st c="623"> as a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="629">user interface</st></strong><st c="643"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="645">UI</st></strong><st c="647">). </st><st c="651">It covers setting up the Gradio environment, integrating RAG models, creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to use your RAG system like a typical web application, and hosting it online in a permanent and free space. </st><st c="881">You will learn how to quickly prototype and deploy RAG-powered applications, enabling end users to interact with AI models in </st><st c="1007">real time.</st></p>
			<p><st c="1017">There are entire books written on how to build an interface, and there are many places you can provide an interface, such as in a web browser or through a mobile app. </st><st c="1185">But luckily, using Gradio, we can provide you with an easy way to offer an interface for your RAG-based app, without having to do extensive web or mobile development. </st><st c="1352">This makes it easier to share and </st><st c="1386">demo models.</st></p>
			<p><st c="1398">In the chapter, we will specifically cover the </st><st c="1446">following topics:</st></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="1463">Why Gradio?</st></li>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="1565">Let’s first discuss why Gradio is an important part of your RAG </st><st c="1630">development efforts.</st></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/><st c="1650">Technical requirements</st></h1>
			<p><st c="1673">The code for this chapter is </st><st c="1703">here: </st><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unlocking-Data-with-Generative-AI-and-RAG/tree/main/Chapter_06 "><st c="1709">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unlocking-Data-with-Generative-AI-and-RAG/tree/main/Chapter_06</st></a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/><st c="1806">Why Gradio?</st></h1>
			<p><st c="1818">Up until this point, we have</st><a id="_idIndexMarker271"/><st c="1847"> focused on topics that are typically relegated to the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker272"/><st c="1902">world of data science. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="1925">Machine learning</st></strong><st c="1941">, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="1943">natural language processing</st></strong><st c="1970"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="1972">NLP</st></strong><st c="1975">), </st><strong class="bold"><st c="1979">generative artificial intelligence</st></strong><st c="2013"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2015">generative AI</st></strong><st c="2028">), </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2032">large language models</st></strong><st c="2053"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="2055">LLMs</st></strong><st c="2059">), and RAG are technologies that require significant </st><a id="_idIndexMarker273"/><st c="2113">expertise and often take up enough </st><a id="_idIndexMarker274"/><st c="2148">time that we are not able to build expertise in other technical areas, such as working with web technologies and building web frontends. </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2285">Web development</st></strong><st c="2300"> is a highly technical field in its own right, and requires significant experience</st><a id="_idIndexMarker275"/><st c="2382"> and expertise to </st><st c="2400">implement successfully.</st></p>
			<p><st c="2423">However, with RAG, it can be very helpful to have a UI, especially if you want to test it or demonstrate it to potential users. </st><st c="2552">How can we provide that if we do not have the time to learn </st><st c="2612">web development?</st></p>
			<p><st c="2628">That is the primary reason why many data scientists, including myself, use</st><a id="_idIndexMarker276"/><st c="2703"> Gradio. </st><st c="2712">It allows you to get a UI up and running very quickly (relative to building a web frontend) in a sharable format and even with some basic authentication features. </st><st c="2875">This is not going to put any web developers out of a job, as Gradio would not be a great choice if you wanted to turn your RAG application into a full-fledged robust website. </st><st c="3050">But what it will do is allow you, as someone with very limited time to build a website, to get a UI that is well suited to RAG applications up and running </st><st c="3205">within minutes!</st></p>
			<p><st c="3220">Because the idea here is to allow you to keep most of your focus on RAG development, rather than web development, we are going to streamline our discussion about Gradio to just the components that will help you get your RAG application on the web and shareable. </st><st c="3483">However, as your RAG development continues, we encourage you to further investigate the capabilities of Gradio to see if there is anything else that it can do for your </st><st c="3651">specific efforts!</st></p>
			<p><st c="3668">With that in mind, let’s talk about the main benefits of Gradio when building a </st><st c="3749">RAG application.</st></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/><st c="3765">Benefits of using Gradio</st></h1>
			<p><st c="3790">Besides </st><a id="_idIndexMarker277"/><st c="3799">being just really easy to use for non-web developers, Gradio has many advantages. </st><st c="3881">Gradio’s core library is open source, which means developers can freely use, modify, and contribute to the project. </st><st c="3997">Gradio integrates well with widely used machine learning frameworks, such </st><a id="_idIndexMarker278"/><st c="4071">as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4074">TensorFlow</st></strong><st c="4084">, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4086">PyTorch</st></strong><st c="4093">, and </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4099">Keras</st></strong><st c="4104">. In </st><a id="_idIndexMarker279"/><st c="4109">addition to the open source library, Gradio offers a hosted</st><a id="_idIndexMarker280"/><st c="4168"> platform where developers can deploy their model interfaces and manage access. </st><st c="4248">Gradio includes features that facilitate collaboration among teams working on machine learning projects, such as sharing interfaces and </st><st c="4384">collecting feedback.</st></p>
			<p><st c="4404">Another exciting feature of Gradio is that it integrates well</st><a id="_idIndexMarker281"/><st c="4466"> with </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4472">Hugging Face</st></strong><st c="4484">. Founded by former employees of OpenAI, Hugging Face has a lot of resources meant to support the generative AI community, such as model sharing and dataset hosting. </st><st c="4650">One of the resources is the ability to set up a permanent link to your Gradio demo on the internet, using </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4756">Hugging Face Spaces</st></strong><st c="4775">. Hugging Face Spaces provides the infrastructure to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker282"/><st c="4828">permanently host your machine learning model for free! </st><st c="4883">Take a look at the Hugging Face website to find out more about </st><st c="4946">their Spaces.</st></p>
			<p><st c="4959">There are also some limitations to using Gradio when it comes to using it for your RAG application and it is important to know what </st><st c="5092">those are.</st></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/><st c="5102">Limitations to using Gradio</st></h1>
			<p><st c="5130">Probably the most important thing to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/><st c="5168">keep in mind with Gradio is that it does not provide adequate support for building a production-level app that will be interfacing with hundreds, thousands, or even millions of users. </st><st c="5352">In this case, you probably want to hire someone with expertise in building frontends for large-scale production-level applications. </st><st c="5484">But for what we call</st><a id="_idIndexMarker284"/><st c="5504"> a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="5507">proof-of-concept</st></strong><st c="5523"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="5525">POC</st></strong><st c="5528">) type of app, or to build something that allows you to test out your app with users with basic interactivity and functionality, Gradio does a </st><st c="5672">fantastic job.</st></p>
			<p><st c="5686">Another limitation that you may come across when using Gradio for RAG applications is the lack of flexibility in what you can build. </st><st c="5820">For many RAG applications, especially when building a POC, this will not be an issue. </st><st c="5906">But if you or your users start demanding more sophisticated UI features, Gradio is going to be much more limiting than a full web development framework. </st><st c="6059">Not only is it good for you to understand this, but it is good to set these expectations with your users, helping them to understand that this is only meant for a simple </st><st c="6229">demo</st><a id="_idIndexMarker285"/><st c="6233"> application.</st></p>
			<p><st c="6246">Let’s dive right into the code and walk through how Gradio can give your RAG application the interface </st><st c="6350">it deserves.</st></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/><st c="6362">Code lab – Adding a Gradio interface</st></h1>
			<p><st c="6399">This code picks up right where we </st><a id="_idIndexMarker286"/><st c="6434">left off in </st><a href="B22475_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic"><st c="6446">Chapter 5</st></em></a><st c="6455">, except for the last set of lines representing the prompt probe attack. </st><st c="6528">As we have at the beginning of all of our code labs, we are going to start with installing a new package, which is, of course, Gradio! </st><st c="6663">We are also going to uninstall </st><code><st c="6694">uvloop</st></code><st c="6700">, because of a conflict with our </st><st c="6733">other packages:</st></p>
			<pre class="source-code"><st c="6748">
%pip install gradio
%pip uninstall uvloop -y</st></pre>
			<p><st c="6793">This installs the </st><code><st c="6812">gradio</st></code><st c="6818"> package and removes the conflicting </st><code><st c="6855">uvloop</st></code><st c="6861"> package.</st></p>
			<p><st c="6870">Next, we will add multiple packages to the list </st><st c="6919">of imports:</st></p>
			<pre class="source-code"><st c="6930">
import asyncio
import nest_asyncio
asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy())
nest_asyncio.apply()
import gradio as gr</st></pre>
			<p><st c="7070">These lines import the </st><code><st c="7094">asyncio</st></code><st c="7101"> and </st><code><st c="7106">nest_asyncio</st></code><st c="7118"> libraries and set up the event loop policy. </st><code><st c="7163">asyncio</st></code><st c="7170"> is a library for writing concurrent code using coroutines and event loops. </st><code><st c="7246">nest_asyncio</st></code><st c="7258"> is a library that allows nested event loops in Jupyter notebook. </st><st c="7324">The </st><code><st c="7328">asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy())</st></code><st c="7391"> line sets the event loop policy to the default policy. </st><code><st c="7447">nest_asyncio.apply()</st></code><st c="7467"> applies the necessary patches to enable nested event loops. </st><st c="7528">Then, lastly, we import the </st><code><st c="7556">gradio</st></code><st c="7562"> package and assign it the </st><code><st c="7589">gr</st></code><st c="7591"> alias </st><st c="7598">for convenience.</st></p>
			<p><st c="7614">After adding the imports, we </st><a id="_idIndexMarker287"/><st c="7644">only need to add this code at the end of the existing code to set up our </st><st c="7717">Gradio interface:</st></p>
			<pre class="source-code"><st c="7734">

    source_list = ", ".join(sources)
    return relevance_score, final_answer, source_list</st></pre>
			<p><st c="8063">The </st><code><st c="8068">process_question</st></code><st c="8084"> function is the function that is invoked when you hit that </st><code><st c="8198">gr.Interface</st></code><st c="8210"> code, but this is the function that is called and processed. </st><st c="8272">The </st><code><st c="8276">process_question</st></code><st c="8292"> function takes the question you submit as a user as input and processes it using our RAG pipeline. </st><st c="8392">It invokes the </st><code><st c="8407">rag_chain_with_source</st></code><st c="8428"> object with the given question and retrieves the relevance score, final answer, and sources from the result. </st><st c="8538">The function then joins the sources into a comma-separated string and returns the relevance score, final answer, and </st><st c="8655">source list.</st></p>
			<p><st c="8667">Next, we will set up an instance of the </st><st c="8708">Gradio interface:</st></p>

			<p><st c="9808">The only action left to take is to launch </st><st c="9851">the interface:</st></p>
			<pre class="source-code"><st c="9865">
demo.launch(share=True, debug=True)</st></pre>
			<p><st c="9901">The </st><code><st c="9906">demo.launch(share=True, debug=True)</st></code><st c="9941"> line launches the Gradio interface. </st><st c="9978">The </st><code><st c="9982">share=True</st></code><st c="9992"> parameter enables the sharing feature of Gradio, generating a publicly accessible URL that you can share with others to access your interface. </st><st c="10136">Gradio uses a tunneling service to provide this functionality, allowing anyone with the URL to interact with your interface without needing to run the code locally. </st><st c="10301">The </st><code><st c="10305">debug=True</st></code><st c="10315"> parameter enables debug mode, providing additional information and tools for debugging and development. </st><st c="10420">In debug mode, Gradio displays detailed error messages in the browser console if any errors occur during the execution of the </st><code><st c="10546">process_question</st></code><st c="10562"> function.</st></p>
			<p><st c="10572">I consider </st><code><st c="10584">demo.launch(share=True, debug=True)</st></code><st c="10619"> to be a special line of code compared to all of the other code you’ve written in this book. </st><st c="10712">This is because it does something you haven’t seen before; it calls on Gradio to start a local web server to host the interface defined by </st><code><st c="10851">gr.Interface(...)</st></code><st c="10868">. When you run the cell, you will notice that it continues to run in perpetuity until you stop it. </st><st c="10967">You will also notice that you cannot run any other cells without </st><st c="11032">stopping it.</st></p>
			<p><st c="11044">There is one more optional parameter we want to make you aware of: the auth parameter. </st><st c="11132">You add it to the </st><code><st c="11150">demo.launch</st></code><st c="11161"> function </st><st c="11171">like this:</st></p>
			<pre class="source-code"><st c="11181">
demo.launch(share=True, debug=True, auth=("admin", "pass1234"))</st></pre>
			<p><st c="11245">This will add a simple level of authentication, in case you are sharing your application publicly. </st><st c="11345">It generates an extra interface that requires the username (</st><code><st c="11405">admin</st></code><st c="11411">) and password (</st><code><st c="11428">pass1234</st></code><st c="11437">) that you add to it. </st><st c="11460">Change </st><code><st c="11467">admin/pass1234</st></code><st c="11481"> to whatever you want, but definitely change it! </st><st c="11530">Share those credentials with only the users you want to have access to your RAG application. </st><st c="11623">Keep in mind that this is not highly secure, but it does serve at least a baseline purpose to limit </st><st c="11723">user access.</st></p>
			<p><st c="11735">Now, you have an active web </st><a id="_idIndexMarker289"/><st c="11764">server that takes input, processes it, and will react and return new interface elements based on the code you have written for your Gradio interface. </st><st c="11914">This is something that used to require significant expertise in web development, but now you can have it up and running in minutes!  </st><st c="12046">This lets you focus on what you want to focus on: writing the code for your </st><st c="12122">RAG application!</st></p>
			<p><st c="12138">Once you have run the Gradio code in this cell, the interface becomes interactive, allowing users to enter questions in the input textbox. </st><st c="12278">As we described previously, when a user submits a question, the </st><code><st c="12342">process_question</st></code><st c="12358"> function is called with the user’s question as input. </st><st c="12413">The function invokes a RAG pipeline, </st><code><st c="12450">rag_chain_with_source</st></code><st c="12471">, with the question and retrieves the relevance score, final answer, and sources from the result. </st><st c="12569">It then returns the relevance score, final answer, and source list. </st><st c="12637">Gradio updates the output textboxes with the returned values, displaying the relevance score, final answer, and sources to </st><st c="12760">the user.</st></p>
			<p><st c="12769">The interface remains active and responsive until the cell execution completes or until </st><code><st c="12858">gr.close_all()</st></code><st c="12872"> is called to close all active </st><st c="12903">Gradio interfaces.</st></p>
			<p><st c="12921">Ultimately, when you run this notebook cell with Gradio code, you will end up with an interface that looks like </st><em class="italic"><st c="13034">Figure 6</st></em><em class="italic"><st c="13042">.1</st></em><st c="13044">.

			<p><st c="15578">Let’s talk about a few things that are happening in this interface when the response comes back from the LLM. </st><st c="15689">It starts with the relevancy score, which is what we added in </st><a href="B22475_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic"><st c="15751">Chapter 5</st></em></a><st c="15760"> when using an LLM to determine the relevancy of the question as a security measure to block prompt injections. </st><st c="15872">In an application that you present to your users, this likely will not be displayed, but it is shown here as an example of showing additional information alongside your</st><a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> <st c="16040">LLM response.</st></p>
			<p><st c="16054">Speaking of the LLM response, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="16085">Final Answer</st></strong><st c="16097"> from ChatGPT 4 was already formatted in a way that it displays with markup. </st><st c="16174">Gradio will automatically use the line breaks from that markup and display the text, accordingly, splitting up the paragraphs in </st><st c="16303">this case.</st></p>
			<p><st c="16313">Lastly, the sources are a list of four sources, indicating there were four sources returned in the retriever. </st><st c="16424">This comes from the code we set up in </st><a href="B22475_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic"><st c="16462">Chapter 3</st></em></a><st c="16471"> when we added the ability to carry the sources of the retrieved results forward in the metadata so that we have it available for display in the UI. </st><st c="16620">We are finally seeing the results of this effort here in </st><a href="B22475_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><em class="italic"><st c="16677">Chapter 6</st></em></a><st c="16686">, now that we have a UI to show! </st><st c="16719">You may have noticed that all four sources are the same. </st><st c="16776">This is a result of this being a small example, where we only pull in one source </st><st c="16857">of data.</st></p>
			<p><st c="16865">In most applications, you will likely </st><a id="_idIndexMarker292"/><st c="16904">pull in many more sources of information to your data, and there will be more sources listed in that list. </st><st c="17011">If you add more sources of data to this code that are relevant to the question asked, you should see them appear in this list </st><st c="17137">of sources.</st></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/><st c="17148">Summary</st></h1>
			<p><st c="17156">In this chapter, we went through a practical guide on creating interactive applications using RAG and Gradio as the UI. </st><st c="17277">We covered setting up the Gradio environment, integrating RAG models, and creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the RAG system like a typical web application. </st><st c="17468">Developers can quickly prototype and deploy RAG-powered applications, enabling end users to interact with RAG pipelines in </st><st c="17591">real time.</st></p>
			<p><st c="17601">We also discussed the benefits of using Gradio, such as its open source nature, integration with popular machine learning frameworks, and collaboration features and Gradio’s integration with Hugging Face, which provides resources for the generative AI community, including the ability to host Gradio demos permanently and for free using Hugging </st><st c="17947">Face Spaces.</st></p>
			<p><st c="17959">With the code lab, we learned how to add a Gradio interface to a RAG application. </st><st c="18042">We created the Gradio interface using </st><code><st c="18080">gr.Interface</st></code><st c="18092">, specifying the input and output components, title, and description. </st><st c="18162">We launched the interface with </st><code><st c="18193">demo.launch()</st></code><st c="18206">, which starts a local web server to host the interface. </st><st c="18263">This involved creating a </st><code><st c="18288">process_question</st></code><st c="18304"> function that invokes the RAG pipeline with the user’s question and retrieves the relevance score, final answer, and sources from the result. </st><st c="18447">This process reflects on the Gradio interface, allowing users to enter questions and receive the relevance score, final answer, and sources returned by the </st><st c="18603">RAG system.</st></p>
			<p><st c="18614">The chapter also discussed how the sources are carried forward from the retriever and displayed in the UI, showcasing the effort put into adding this functionality in </st><st c="18782">previous chapters.</st></p>
			<p><st c="18800">This was just an introduction to Gradio though. </st><st c="18849">We encourage you to go to the Gradio website (</st><a href="https://www.gradio.app/"><st c="18895">https://www.gradio.app/</st></a><st c="18919">) and walk through their </st><strong class="bold"><st c="18945">Quickstart</st></strong><st c="18955"> guide and their documentation to learn all the other important functionality their </st><st c="19039">platform provides.</st></p>
			<p><st c="19057">In the next chapter, we will explore the critical role that vectors and vector stores play in enhancing </st><st c="19162">RAG systems.</st></p>
