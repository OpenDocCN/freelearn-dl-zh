- en: Developing games is a passion for some, and I believe that this is because we
    are able to create a world that is completely imagined by us; this is like being
    a god, and the AI characters that we place there are the habitants of that world
    that we have just created. We are free to imagine how they will behave, we can
    create a society according to our imagination, we are able to create a sweet and
    kind character, but also we can create the most devilish character that ever existed--the
    possibilities are endless, and that is why we will always have new game ideas
    coming out. No matter what game genre we decide to develop, the world and their
    characters will be the essence of our vision; this is what will make our game
    unique, and ideally we should be able to create everything that we have in mind,
    just as we imagine. This book was conceived with that in mind, that all of us
    should be able to create the ideas that we have and that we shouldn't limit our
    imagination, so this book will cover the foundations of creating an artificial
    character, and after reading it, we should be able to explore all the topics that
    you have learned, creating AI characters that fit perfectly with what we have
    imagined.
