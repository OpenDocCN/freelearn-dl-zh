- en: The life of a programmer can be described as a continual never-ending learning
    pathway. A programmer always faces challenges regarding new technologies or new
    approaches. Generally, during our lives, although we become used to repeated things,
    we are always subjected to new things. The process of learning is one of the most
    interesting topics in science, and there are a number of attempts to describe
    or reproduce the human learning process.

- en: The writing of this book was guided by the challenge of facing new content and
    then mastering it. While the name neural networks may appear strange or even suggest
    that this book is about neurology, we strived to simplify these nuances by focusing
    on your reasons for deciding to purchase this book. We intended to build a framework
    that shows you that neural networks are actually simple and easy to understand,
    and absolutely no prior knowledge on this topic is required to fully understand
    the concepts we present here.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, we encourage you to explore the content of this book to the fullest, beholding
    the power of neural networks when confronting big problems but always with the
    point of view of a beginner. Every concept addressed in this book is explained
    in easy language, and also with a technical background. Our mission in this book
    is to give you an insight into intelligent applications that can be written using
    simple language.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Neural Networks"),
    *Getting Started with Neural Networks*, introduces neural networks concepts and
    shows the very basic neuron structures (Single Layer Perceptrons, Adaline), activation
    functions, weights, and learning algorithms. Besides, this chapter shows the process
    of creating basic neural networks in Java from start to finish.'

    Neural Networks to Learn*, presents the details of the neural network learning
    process. Useful concepts, such as training, test, and validation are introduced.
    We show how to implement training and validation algorithms. This chapter also
    shows methods for error evaluation.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml "Chapter 3. Perceptrons and Supervised Learning"), *Perceptrons
    and Supervised Learning*, gets you acquainted with perceptrons and the supervised
    learning features. We present training algorithms for these types of Neural Network.
    The reader will learn how to implement these features in Java.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml "Chapter 4. Self-Organizing Maps"), *Self-Organizing
    Maps*, introduces unsupervised learning with self-organizing maps, namely the
    Kohonen neural network, and their applications, especially with classification
    and clustering problems.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml "Chapter 5. Forecasting Weather"), *Forecasting Weather*,
    covers one practical problem using neural networks, which is forecasting weather.
    You will be presented with a time series dataset of historical weather records
    from different regions, and learn how to apply preprocessing before presenting
    them to neural networks.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml "Chapter 6. Classifying Disease Diagnosis"), *Classifying
    Disease Diagnosis*, introduces a classification problem, which is also encompassed
    in supervised learning. Using patient records data, a neural network is built
    to act as an expert system, being capable of giving a diagnosis based on patients,
    symptoms.'
