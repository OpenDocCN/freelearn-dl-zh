    It is based on Bayes’ theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis
    (in this case, a document belonging to a particular class), given some observed
    evidence (in this case, the words in the document), is proportional to the probability
    of the evidence given the hypothesis times the prior probability of the hypothesis.
    Naive Bayes assumes that the features (words) are independent of each other given
    the class label, which is where the “naive” part of the name comes from.

    a graph using both labeled and unlabeled data points, with each data point represented
    as a node and edges representing the similarity between nodes. The algorithm works
    by propagating the labels from the labeled nodes to the unlabeled nodes based
    on their similarity.

    begins by assigning initial label probabilities to the unlabeled nodes, typically
    based on their similarity to labeled nodes. Then, an iterative process propagates
    these probabilities throughout the graph until convergence. The final label probabilities
    are used to classify the unlabeled data points.

    classifiers on different views of the data. A view is a subset of features that
    are sufficient for the learning task and are conditionally independent given the
    class label. The basic idea is to use one classifier’s predictions to label some
    of the unlabeled data, and then use that newly labeled data to train the other
    classifier. This process is performed iteratively, with each classifier improving
    the other until a stopping criterion is met.

    set of labeled articles and a large set of unlabeled articles.
  id: totrans-58
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A possible approach could be to use label propagation by creating a graph of
    articles where the nodes represent the articles and the edges represent the similarity
    between the articles. The similarity could be based on various factors, such as
    the words used, the topics covered, or the citation networks between the articles.
    After propagating the labels, we can classify the unlabeled articles based on
    the final label probabilities.

    such as the abstract and the full text of the articles. We would train two classifiers,
    one for each view, and iteratively update the classifiers using the predictions
    made by the other classifier on the unlabeled data.

    need to consider the existence of two words beside each other. For example, “very
    good” and “not good” can have different meanings. To achieve this goal, we can
    use N-grams.

- en: N-grams are a generalization of the bag-of-words model that takes into account
    the order of words by considering sequences of *n* consecutive words. An N-gram
    is a contiguous sequence of *n* items (typically words) from a given text. For
    example, in the sentence “The cat is on the mat,” the 2-grams (bigrams) would
    be “The cat,” “cat is,” “is on,” “on the,” and “the mat.”

    improve the performance of the classifier. However, it also increases the dimensionality

    is that they do not capture word order, context, or semantic relationships between

    is the number of active viewers that your streaming service currently has, and
    the dependent variable is the risk that the company’s servers have for maxing
    out their capacity. The tentative design plan would be to build a regressor that
    estimates the risk at any given moment. A strong proxy for the feasibility of
    developing a successful regressor could be calculating the linear correlation
    between the historical data points. Calculating linear correlation based on sample
    data is easy and quick and if its result is close to 1 (or -1 in cases different
    than our business problem), then it means that a linear regressor is guaranteed
    to succeed, thus, making it a great proxy. However, note that if the linear correlation
    is close to 0, it doesn’t necessarily mean that a regressor would fail, only that
    a linear regression would fail. In such a case, a different proxy should be deferred
    to.

    have that method suit a variable that is text and not numeric, we’ll go back to
    the origin and calculate a measure for the statistical dependency between the
    input text and the output class. Statistical dependency is the most basic measure
    for a relationship between variables and thus doesn’t require either of them to
    be numeric.

    some experience as ML developers tend to get better at this over time. The main
    pitfall in this task is the ability to set up an objective assessment of the result.
    That objective assessment is done by applying the finished model to data it had
    never “seen” before. But often folks who are only starting to apply ML find themselves
    improving their design after seeing what the results of that held-out set are.
    This leads to a feedback loop where the design is practically fitted to the no-longer-held-out
    set. While this may indeed improve the model and the design, it takes away from
    the ability to provide an objective forecast of how the model would perform when
    implemented in the real world. In the real world, it would see data that is truly
    held out and that it wasn’t fitted to.

    Its purpose is to be presented. For instance, when looking to evaluate how much

    calculate an estimation for that measure of contribution and present it to leadership.
  id: totrans-366

- en: Another form of implementation is within a dashboard in real time. For instance,
    the model calculates the predicted risk of patients coming to the emergency room,
    and it does so on a daily cadence. The results are aggregated and a graph is presented
    on the hospital dashboard to show the expected number of people who would come
    to the emergency room for every day of the next 30 days.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A more advanced and common form is when the output of the data is directed so
    that it can be fed into downstream tasks. The model would then be implemented
    in production to become a microservice within a larger production pipeline. An
    example of that is when a classifier evaluates every post on your company’s Facebook
    page. When it identifies offensive language, it outputs a detection that then
    passes down the pipeline to another system that removes that post and perhaps
    blocks that user.

    engineer who would dictate the constraints to the ML team. These constraints may
    be around computation and timing resources, but they would also be around code
    design. Often, basic code files, such as `.py` files, are necessary.

    as a set of numerical features. The main reason for this is that traditional ML
    models are designed to accept numbers as input, not text. For instance, a common
    linear regression or logistic regression model is applied to numbers, not words,
    categories, or image pixels. Thus, we need to suggest a numeric representation
    for the text. This design constraint is lifted when working with **language models**
    such as **BERT** and **GPT**. We will see this in the coming chapters.

    values. When a binary (that is, **one-hot encoding**) method is chosen, the numerical
    feature that represents some N-gram gets a “1” when the observed text includes
    that N-gram, and “0” otherwise. See *Figure 5**.3* for an example. If a BOW approach
    is chosen, then the value of the feature is the number of times the N-gram appears
    in the observed text. Another common feature engineering method that isn’t implemented
    here is **TF-IDF**.

    0, this doesn’t mean that *X* can’t infer *Y*. It just means that *X* cannot infer

    is that we perform the most simple evaluation of statistical dependency, a univariate

    **feasibility study** is successful, it not only helps us by confirming our plan,
    but it often hints toward the next steps that we should take. As we saw, some
    features are indicative of the class, and we learned which are the most significant.
    This allows us to reduce the feature space that the classification model will
    need to partition. We do that by keeping the most indicative features for each
    of the two classes. The number of features that we choose to keep would ideally
    be derived by computation constraints (for example, too many features would take
    too long to compute a model around), model capabilities (for example, too many
    features can’t be handled well by the model due to co-linearity), and optimization
    of the train results. In our code, we fixed this number to make things quick and
    simple.

    get “thrown out.” It is possible and sometimes recommended to skip this part of
