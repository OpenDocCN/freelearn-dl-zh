    or more specifically, whether the tank is nearby so that they can shoot at it,
    so we'll use a sphere trigger to model the towers' field of vision and sensing.

    and set `canFire` to `false`, we start a counter from 0 up to `fireSpeed`, before
    we set `canFire` to `true` again. The `FireProjectile()` method handles the instantiation
    of the projectile and shoots it out toward the direction the gun is pointing to

    trigger. Remember the `TankInRange` bool that drives the transitions for our state
    machine? This variable gets set to `true` here when we enter the trigger and back
    to `false` as we exit. Essentially, when the tank enters the gun's sphere of "vision,"
    it instantly locks on to the tank, and the lock is released when the tank leaves

- en: As we conclude this book, take a moment and pat yourself on the back! We've
    covered a lot of ground, and covered a lot of topics. You've now learned about
    state machines, behavior trees, A*, fuzzy logic, and so much more. What's most
    exciting is to think of all the ways in which you can mix-and-match and apply
    these concepts. Hopefully, throughout this book you've been thinking of ways to
    enhance your existing or upcoming games with these concepts. You now have the
    tools to create smarter inhabitants for your digital worlds. Good luck!
