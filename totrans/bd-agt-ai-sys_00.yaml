- en: '*Building Agentic AI Systems* is designed to provide both a theoretical foundation
    and practical guidance on generative AI and agent-based intelligence. Generative
    AI and agentic systems are at the forefront of the next wave of AI, driving automation,
    creativity, and decision-making in ways that were previously unimaginable. By
    enabling machines to generate text, images, and even strategic plans while reasoning
    and adapting autonomously, these technologies are transforming industries such
    as healthcare, finance, and robotics.'

- en: The book begins by introducing generative AI, covering key models such as **Variational
    Autoencoders** ( **VAEs** ), **Generative Adversarial Networks** ( **GANs** ),
    and autoregressive models. We explore their applications in content creation,
    design, and scientific research while addressing the limitations and challenges
    of these models.

- en: Next, we dive into the world of agentic systems, defining concepts such as agency,
    autonomy, and multi-agent collaboration. We analyze different agent architectures—deliberative,
    reactive, and hybrid—and explore how multiple agents can interact, cooperate,
    and coordinate toward common goals.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the foundations are established, we move into practical implementation.
    We explore how agents can reflect on their own reasoning processes, plan, and
    use external tools effectively. This includes hands-on techniques for meta-reasoning,
    self-explanation, strategic planning, and multi-agent coordination. The book also
    introduces best practices for designing intelligent, trustworthy AI agents, balancing
    autonomy with control, and ensuring ethical and responsible AI development.

- en: To conclude, we examine real-world use cases and applications across multiple
    domains, from NLP and robotics to decision support and optimization. We also explore
    trust, transparency, bias mitigation, and AI safety—key elements for ensuring
    the reliability of AI-driven systems.
