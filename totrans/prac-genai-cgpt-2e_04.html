<p class="normal">In this part, we will start our journey through the landscape of new possibilities that ChatGPT brings to the market. From daily productivity to domain-specific use cases, you will get familiar with the capabilities of ChatGPT and how it can be used as a reasoning engine for various tasks.</p>
<p class="normal">Once we have explored the technical prerequisites, this part jumps into an overview of the ChatGPT user interface, including chat management and question modifications.</p>
<p class="normal">It then moves toward one of the most important elements required to get the best out of ChatGPT and, in general, out of LLMs: the concept of prompt design. Here, you will get familiar with powerful techniques to make ChatGPT work at its best, including recent developments and research papers about powerful techniques.</p>
<p class="normal">This part also focuses on concrete examples of how to use ChatGPT in operative activities, starting with daily productivity and moving to more domain-specific disciplines, such as marketing, development, research, and visual creativity. Here, you will be able to not only learn about the use cases ChatGPT can cover in those domains but also see concrete examples to replicate them on your own.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, you will see how to further tailor ChatGPT to your specific use cases, leveraging GPTs and the GPT store.</p>
