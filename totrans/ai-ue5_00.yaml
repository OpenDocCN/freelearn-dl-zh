- en: Since its very beginnings, **artificial intelligence** ( **AI** ) has transformed
    the landscape of game development, offering players enriched and immersive experiences
    that were once thought to be the realm of science fiction. Unlike other methods
    of game development, where scripted events dictate more rigid player interactions,
    AI introduces a level of unpredictability and responsiveness that brings virtual
    worlds to life.

- en: In recent years, advancements in AI technology have made it more accessible
    and easier to implement, resulting in a surge of intelligent gameplay across various
    genres. This evolution has made AI a cornerstone of modern game development, with
    millions of players benefiting from smarter, more engaging interactions in their
    favorite games every day.

- en: Unreal Engine stands out as an advanced platform for developers looking to harness
    the power of AI in their projects. With a robust suite of tools and features tailored
    specifically for AI development – such as behavior trees and the Navigation System
    – Unreal Engine enables creators to build sophisticated AI systems that enhance
    gameplay and player engagement.
