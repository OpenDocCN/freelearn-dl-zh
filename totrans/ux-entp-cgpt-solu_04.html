			<p class="author-quote">A use case is a description of the possible sequences of interactions between the system under discussion and its external actors, related to a particular goal.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">- Alistair Cockburn</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There is a wealth of explanations around writing use cases. I suspect we have all created something we call <strong class="bold">use cases</strong>. We will first clarify a robust definition for a use case to work from the same understanding. Then, we can go into examples within use cases to look for opportunities to insert generative AI into the mix, while considering where a ChatGPT integration might be challenging or where issues might arise. By the end of this chapter, you will be armed with the ability to take the research tools from <a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em> document use cases in this chapter, and be ready to prioritize use cases for a backlog in <a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em>. Experts in use case development will benefit from learning how to apply ChatGPT to the use case process. I encourage all readers to be knowledgeable about use case development, as it is not just for designers!</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor060" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Understanding use case basics</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">These five essential use case components<a id="_idIndexMarker131" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> have been consistent over the years:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Primary actor</strong>: Who is the person or type<a id="_idIndexMarker132" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> of person who will use this case?</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Preconditions</strong>: What has to have happened for this use case to be used?</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">How to pick the proper use cases</p>
			<p class="callout">I suggested Alistair Cockburn’s book in <a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em> as the best primer<a id="_idIndexMarker133" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> on use cases because he explains how to write them effectively. We should also be sensitive when picking the proper use cases. It’s possible to write a well-formed use case that does not represent significant business value. Cockburn’s book covers the proper construction of use cases and provides examples. Consider printing out the one-page summary from <a href="B21964_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Recognizing the Power of Design in ChatGPT</em>. It has plenty of great suggestions to help write accurate use cases.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor061" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Use case or user stories</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Some people have heard of <strong class="bold">user stories</strong>, and the overlap with use cases<a id="_idIndexMarker134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> is significant. User stories are typically more general and treated as a narrative. As we explained in <a href="B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conducting Effective User Research</em> we tell an actual story with the storyboard cartoon. At the same time, a use case is more descriptive of the interactions. Storytelling can set the mood and integrate the context and actor, while the use case defines this upfront. Writing a story from a use case is easier because what should happen and the order of events is known. Going from a user story to a use case is more complex because of the need to address the details of each step. The focus here is on the use case approach to provide details to estimate and understand the value of the interactions and the engineering effort needed to address the problem. It would be easier to ask ChatGPT to create a story from a use case<a id="_idIndexMarker135" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> than to make the use case from the story.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can create use cases and use the process to identify steps suitable for ChatGPT. We can also learn enough about when not to apply ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here’s<a id="_idIndexMarker136" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> a step-by-step guide:</p>
			<ol class="calibre12">
				<li class="calibre8">Understand how to write compelling use cases.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Identify the use cases and any needed user stories.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Break down the use cases into steps.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Identify places in those steps where ChatGPT can provide support (and where it would not be suited).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Work with the development team to explore the value of ChatGPT to solve specific steps in the problem. Prioritize the ones with the most value and least cost (more on this in the next chapter).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Ignore problems that are not well suited to ChatGPT.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre3">We will use a sample use case to explore how to include ChatGPT in the process. First, we can review how ChatGPT might be engaged within the use case.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor062" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Establishing a baseline with ChatGPT</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Considering all the activities<a id="_idIndexMarker137" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> customers<a id="_idIndexMarker138" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> do and even within the company for employees, this can add up to many existing use cases. Some will be ripe for improvement by integrating a generative solution such as ChatGPT. Conversely, avoid applying ChatGPT when it is of limited or no value.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Throughout the book, we cover different ways of understanding what ChatGPT will be good at and what it won’t. Because we expect solutions to merge enterprise data with one or more generative models (and some specific models, as discussed in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em>, are better at particular tasks), it is good to understand what it can and can’t do.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this context, there might<a id="_idIndexMarker139" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> be a chat interaction, recommendation UI, enterprise<a id="_idIndexMarker140" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> workflow, or even a backend solution, but ChatGPT might only apply part of the problem. ChatGPT was asked what it was good at and provided the results in <em class="italic">Table 3.1</em>.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 3.1 – ChatGPT’s opinion of its capabilities</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This book covers some of these items from <em class="italic">Table 3.1</em>. Challenging areas like sensitive, emotional, or relationship advice are only briefly addressed. Most enterprise solutions will need to handle the problem of specialized knowledge by using a model that can be adapted to support enterprise knowledge. We will cover this in subsequent chapters. Even ChatGPT fails to explain that more value might be gained from applying ChatGPT at a process step, optimized and tuned to do one specific task in a sequence. ChatGPT doesn’t have to do everything (as we say, don’t <em class="italic">boil the ocean</em>). That is the beauty of creating a use case to break down a process into a series of steps. It is easier to compare step details to the capabilities of ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s take an example. Customers commonly deploy patches or firmware updates for a variety of products. A mobile phone gets regular updates, and enterprise software gets patched, even in the cloud. In the cloud, consumers rarely see this as patching is done behind the scenes, typically without an outage for critical systems. Someone is working on this problem on our behalf. With personal devices such as phones, TVs, and even a toaster, the user manages the process: download software updates, schedule it for later (maybe while sleeping), or pick and choose when and what update to take. For the enterprise, there might be dozens of patches and updates to take and test before deploying them. This is the big brother version of updating a phone.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is an example use case of a simplified enterprise system consisting of a step, intent, and system response (processes for patching can be far more complex because of customization, integrations, and legal or regional requirements):</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Primary actor</strong>:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8">System administrator, patch manager, or by operations</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Preconditions</strong>:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8">The user is signed into the system</li><li class="calibre8">The software patches are available</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Triggers</strong>:<ul class="calibre19"><li class="calibre8">Recommended available patch details are emailed to the actor</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">The following section will expand on this basic patching use case by identifying where ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker141" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> can be applied. This is brainstorming: find opportunities in the use case where gaps exist and identify what ChatGPT can do for customers at each step.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor063" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Example use case for a ChatGPT instance – patching software</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">This use case is for a traditional<a id="_idIndexMarker142" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> graphical user interface. Even<a id="_idIndexMarker143" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> in a single use case, there might be multiple applications of a generative<a id="_idIndexMarker144" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> enhancement to adapt the <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>). We consider the mantra that <em class="italic">the best user interface is no user interface</em>. Though an overarching goal might be to automate everything, for this example, we presume a complex scenario where human interaction is necessary. But automation of steps along the journey is possible.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can expand the details of an enterprise patching example. Large enterprises frequently manage their software deployments. Even offloading this work to the cloud just transitions the problem to the cloud service provider. The problem is still the same for those vendors. This software is 100 times more complex than our personal updates, containing 1,000 to 10,000 possible patches, with hundreds of instances of that software running in various departments and on multiple development, test, and staging servers. Knowing precisely what is patched and how that might impact the computers becomes essential. It is a complex and time-consuming process. This is partially why we see so many security breaches in the news. It is not because the software is insecure but because the processes are complex and fraught with possible error. In most cases, vendors have already provided patches to fix security issues, sometimes years earlier. Companies are reluctant to patch because of the complexity and sometimes the risk involved in bringing down a piece of software, which means their systems are vulnerable.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is a simplified version of this complex process to help us work with this use case. Notice how each step in <em class="italic">Table 3.2</em> resolves to actions or experiences that the system needs to address. UI will be designed from this use case, but <em class="italic">we are not defining the UI in the use case</em>. The high-level needs of each step are documented. There are better times to determine the exact information, layout, and details for patching with the UI design. There is an entire flow and details just for the patch detail’s view; the primary use case does not cover this. The same would be said for the plan concept introduced in <em class="italic">Step 3</em>. A plan is a collection of patches we can test and deploy simultaneously. A plan would have more than just the name. A separate use case can help define the metadata for the plan (who has worked on it, dates, contents, state, and deployment details). Review the steps in the use case to understand the types of interactions we might need to handle at each phase. This use case is about viewing patch recommendations, deciding which patches to include in a plan, and then scheduling and deploying those patches. Based on our understanding of what ChatGPT is good at, we can think about how it might help us in these steps.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The last column of the table identifies opportunities for ChatGPT. For those more experienced with use cases, there are extensions to this use case that address conditions that are not typical but expected at each step. I have removed and placed extensions to this use case in <em class="italic">Table 3.3</em> to make it easier to read. Know that there<a id="_idIndexMarker145" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> are many ways of presenting a use case. This is just<a id="_idIndexMarker146" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the one we used for convenience.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 3.2 – An example use case for a patching system</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The primary use cases have multiple places with opportunities to insert ChatGPT. If there is a wealth of data on what patches have been installed and the resulting tickets from those versions and releases, a model can be trained to suggest a collection of patches that work better<a id="_idIndexMarker147" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> together. The LLM can propose a patch plan or at least find issues that could result in a conflict or alternative collections of patches that resolve a conflict. This model could be used before, during, and after the process. This is by no means trivial. It is just an opportunity suited to ChatGPT; it is good at providing examples and test cases. After the fact, different data from monitoring software performance could be used to train ChatGPT to understand or even predict abnormal conditions. Patching, testing, and monitoring can have different training models with varying <a id="_idIndexMarker148" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>prompts, APIs, and results. In this case, uses of the LLM are identified in the table. We break down the steps to a level of detail so that it is easier to imagine a LLM solution. It still might be significant work to make it happen, but the problem is constrained. It can be evaluated to see if there is valuable data that will allow the model to perform successfully.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A case study in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em> presents an example of deploying a dozen tuned models to perform specific tasks in a life cycle. Each step of the process uses a different model. In this case, some patch recommendation steps might not be exposed directly to the customer but be used by other models to refine or support suggestions to the customer.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Additional sequences<a id="_idIndexMarker149" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> that supplement<a id="_idIndexMarker150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the process<a id="_idIndexMarker151" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> or are not the likely<a id="_idIndexMarker152" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> path are called <strong class="bold">extensions</strong> to the use case; some extensions are included in <em class="italic">Table 3.3</em>. Usually, the <a id="_idIndexMarker153" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>primary flow is the <strong class="bold">happy path</strong>, which most people<a id="_idIndexMarker154" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> are likely to follow to achieve success. Extensions supplement the happy path with other necessary functionality. <em class="italic">The happy path is not the only path</em>. A robust enterprise design must consider edge cases, error conditions, slow connectivity and performance bottlenecks, accessibility, internationalization, and other issues.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this case, there are a few extensions to point out. Adding to a plan is standard and typical, but without any plans, the first thing that happens (even if automated) is a new plan, which would be created like a new folder on a desktop. On a computer, the folder is created as <code>untitled</code>. A well designed system automatically selects that text so the user can immediately type and name it. The use case does not describe the behavior at this level. This is good, a product manager can deliver the use case, and the designer can pick this up and develop the UX design. Based on the main flow and general understanding of ChatGPT<a id="_idIndexMarker155" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> capabilities, there are places where ChatGPT might be included to offer entire plans<a id="_idIndexMarker156" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> or make suggestions<a id="_idIndexMarker157" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to resolve conflicts.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 3.3 – Extensions to the patching use case</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Suppose data about what patches have been installed in the field and resulting trouble tickets from those versions and releases are available. In that case, a model can be trained to suggest a collection of patches that will work together. The model can recommend a patch plan or suggest an alternative patch collection that resolves a conflict. Conflicts are patches that don’t play well with other patches. This is by no means trivial. It is just an opportunity that is suited to ChatGPT.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre11">Prioritizing use cases based on usage and value – human resource example</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">It is critical to understand the importance of every flow. If 10 or 20 flows each have five or ten percent of usage, these flows represent almost all usage. However, if primary flows represent only a tiny portion of the interactions, this is called the <strong class="bold">long-tail effect</strong>. If some flows and paths serve few people and are infrequently used, there will be a long-tail distribution for these flows. This means that any single flow will only have a small impact on the user community. When there are a few cases representing most interactions, improvements to these flows or tasks have more value than those with little usage. Long-tailed use cases will not improve the customer experience as dramatically as the ones with the most use. The difference in value between these can be quantified. And if the cost of developing one with the most use is the same as the one with the least use, the choice is obvious. This will be explained in <a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A common distribution (for the statistic geeks, this looks similar to a one-tail normal distribution; real-world data doesn’t always look exactly like a normal curve) looks something like <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.1</em> by sorting use cases most frequently used to least frequent. This dataset is from a human resource (HR) system, so it is not a perfectly smooth distribution. In this example, the few top cases represent the most usage (like the 80/20 rule). In this case, 80% of the usage comes from 20% of the features or capabilities.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – A typical one-sided distribution, a few cases have the most impact</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Fewer big-ticket use cases appear in a long-tailed distribution, which extends further into the less frequently used use cases, as demonstrated in <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.2</em>. It takes more than 40% of the use cases to get to 80% of the usage.</p>

			<h3 class="calibre11">Prioritizing based on the 80/20 rule – Amazon shopping</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Features on Amazon.com are something we can explain with no introduction. This shopping<a id="_idIndexMarker158" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> website has features that represent an 80/20 distribution. Features such as searching for a product, adding it to a cart, and checking out represent the majority of use. Small features make up the rest, such as creating a wish list, registering for an account, or adding a new address. However, if you switch perspectives to looking at products, the most popular product would be less than one percent of sales. Even popular products based on search traffic, such as the Apple Watch, Crocs, AirPods, air fryers, and iPads, might total six million searches, but they represent the top of a long tail of product searches. Compared to the volume of searches of over 200 million, even the top seller is not even one percent of sales. This is a long tail. This article discusses these five search terms out of over 274,000 keyword searches to make the long-tail problem appear even more impressive.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Article <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-searched-items-amazon/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Top 100 most searched items on Amazon</a> (<a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-searched-items-amazon/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-searched-items-amazon/</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The Amazon example demonstrates that the most value will likely be derived from a few features (like the add-to-cart function). Likewise, focusing on content (like items to purchase at Amazon) might create a long-tail problem. In either case, if AI is added for something on the <em class="italic">right</em> of the curve, it will provide less value than something on the <em class="italic">left</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Returning to <em class="italic">Figures 3.1 and 3.2,</em> we can apply the Amazon example to the HR data. Notice that the <em class="italic">Absence Balance </em>item (about vacation time remaining for the employee) has almost 350 interactions in <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.1</em>. It would only be over 250 in a long tail (<em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.2</em>). No one use case stands out in a long tail situation. Spending the same effort on this use case in a long-tail environment would return a different reward.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">It is helpful to know the distribution of use. A more normal distribution means value will likely come from improving a few critical use cases, while the long tail means the impact will be more challenging without covering more use cases.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But even small cases can be relevant. Signing<a id="_idIndexMarker159" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> up customers is a small use case by frequency compared to the usage after registration. Still, no one would argue that getting signups correct and reducing friction in the process isn’t essential. Now that we have covered use cases, we can still consider the impact of a user story.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor064" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Creating a user story from a use case</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Recall that the concept of use <a id="_idIndexMarker160" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>cases and user stories overlap. The form is different. Let’s switch back to the patching example. It provides a robust set of steps that afford various opportunities for applying ChatGPT. Running ChatGPT on the user story from <em class="italic">Table 3.1</em> produced the story accompanying the use case:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
I will give you a use case that includes the user's steps and the resulting system response. Please summarize this into a user story using storytelling techniques. Then, summarize the story into a book synopsis.</pre>			<p class="calibre3">The ChatGPT response to this use case was as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
In the magical kingdom of Systemia, the wise and diligent IT wizard, Merlin, sets out on a quest to secure the kingdom's digital fortress. Armed with the magical tool "PatchMaster," Merlin navigates through a series of enchanting chapters to review, select, and deploy patches across the kingdom's instances.
The story unfolds as Merlin discovers a captivating array of patch recommendations, meticulously builds a Patch Plan, and navigates through the patching odyssey, ensuring every decision is made with precision. The wizard crafts a masterpiece – the Plan – checking for conflicts and issues to guarantee a flawless defense against vulnerabilities.
Testing the waters, Merlin bravely deploys the Plan on a test instance, adjusting and evaluating based on results, showcasing the wisdom of iteration. A grand deployment ensues, scheduled and executed with magical finesse, fortifying the kingdom's defenses.
In a grand finale, Merlin expands the kingdom's shield by deploying the Plan on multiple production instances, declaring victory as the patches are deployed and the kingdom's instances stand secure at their new patch state.
The epilogue reflects on the enduring legend of PatchMaster, as Merlin's wisdom ensures the kingdom's digital realm remains resilient against the forces of vulnerabilities. "Patch Perfect" stands as a testament to the enduring power of thoughtful patch management in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and security.</pre>			<p class="calibre3">This generated story from ChatGPT was not edited in any way (grammar errors included). I want to use this to make a few points. First, ChatGPT has value in our design process. This story is creative and enchanting and could be customized further, giving more directions in the prompt to match a specific style and tone. Second, it is easy to go from a use case to a user story, even though editing the output may be necessary. This could be provided to a cartoon or sketch artist to develop the storyboards for an engaging marketing spin. Additional<a id="_idIndexMarker161" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> ChatGPT refinements could be made to flush out the story beyond the happy path. It could be asked to break down the story into eight storyboard cells that would be more readily visualized as a storyboard.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">It would be best to recognize that it is easier to identify opportunities for ChatGPT using the step-by-step approach in the use cases than in this storytelling format. The audience for a user story is different. The use case has details that the development<a id="_idIndexMarker162" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> team needs, but the story is for upper management, other teams, and marketing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor065" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Prioritizing ChatGPT opportunities from the use case</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">This patching example<a id="_idIndexMarker163" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> is useful because there is an actual cost<a id="_idIndexMarker164" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to apply a ChatGPT solution at every step, including design and development, and the actual cost to run production, stage, and test LLMs. Don’t expect to deploy ChatGPT in all these opportunities, so in <em class="italic">Table 3.4</em>, let’s re-list the steps identified as places for ChatGPT support and score each to see which can unlock the most value for customers. The team can then spend the time and money on the most valuable steps.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Each of these possible stories is scored on three metrics. <a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em> teaches <strong class="bold">User Need Scoring</strong>, the product of the three scores. The higher the score, the more value to the customer. In the next chapter, we will also factor in the development cost. From this analysis, we have three stories with the most value.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 3.4 – Opportunities for ChatGPT within the UX (top two items are bold)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let me break down the scores. All of these stories impact the same number of customers. Only some of our customers do patching, so we ranked this a two on a three-point scale. Three is the highest and is reserved for tasks that most customers do. It is not surprising that patching is done infrequently. Individuals update their phones a few times a year; enterprise customers are more hesitant to update. Each of these steps is done about the same number of times and typically done quarterly, so the frequency of this need is a 1 (again, on a 3-point scale where a two would be most of the time, while a three would be all the time). But test cases are different. It is an ongoing process, so it scores a 3 on the Frequency scale. It is also the one place to catch potential problems before a customer encounters them.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The significant differences in the user score come from the severity. Think of this as the inverse of bug severity. A severity 1 bug is a big deal in most companies. Everyone should agree that this needs to be fixed now, and it should be scored the highest, so it is 4 points. A 3 would be a significant problem, while a 2 is not so much, and a 1 is the least severe issue (typically a severity four bug).</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We document the explanations of the scores so multiple people will learn the process and be able to score similar problems. Since scores range from 1 to 4 points, it keeps the explanations and scoring simple. We want people to be able to repeat scores, share, and learn a common method. Teams develop more complex processes, which can also get in the way. This is discussed in the next chapter.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The list can be prioritized<a id="_idIndexMarker165" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> based on these scores<a id="_idIndexMarker166" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> and values. We will explain in depth how to score stories and, importantly, how to incorporate engineering’s cost into developing these solutions. We can continue our journey knowing we have at least three stories (within <em class="italic">Steps 6, 11</em>, and <em class="italic">12</em>) with significant user value. We will use these same stories in <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em> to explain scoring in more detail.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, we started with an easy example. I am an expert in this space, making this example easy to explain. Business expertise is critical to solve problems with LLMs. If you are not the expert, create a team that balances customer empathy with business expertise.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This patching case is a known set of tasks, and we could quickly identify where ChatGPT solutions might fit. But what about when it takes more work? You may have to explore or do research to determine the best fit. Where do the use cases come from? Whose goals are we trying to achieve? Do you know enough to recognize where ChatGPT should be considered? Challenging questions. I recommend becoming an expert in your product area. The more known about the product or service, the more the user’s goals are understood, and the better ChatGPT capabilities are understood, the easier it will be to recognize opportunities and solutions. Each new version of ChatGPT is different and can cause changes in the plans. As we will explore in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em>, different models can be used for other tasks. We can’t say which model is better; this changes<a id="_idIndexMarker167" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> every few months.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s examine how to define those goals. Remember that these are the user’s goals, not the organization’s needs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor066" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Aligning LLMs with user goals</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s say we have a customer or role<a id="_idIndexMarker168" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> in mind and want to define their goal. This book concerns the user’s goals, not marketing, engineering, or sales. It is up to product leaders to figure out valid user goals and how valuable the goal is to the overall product. Viability is also essential and typically provided by engineering. Compelling use cases can come from anywhere; the head of the company might have a vision, a customer could complain, the product manager gets an idea from a customer, the QA engineer recognizes a shortcut, user researchers uncover a critical workaround, or designers imagine a solution to a pain point for customers. Be less concerned with who comes up with the solution and more focused on how much value it provides. Don’t get hung up on which vendors LLM is needed. As OpenAI and the industry evolve, a broad range of models with specific capabilities and costs will be available. This fit-to-purpose allows building solutions with a suite of LLMs in one product.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor067" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Applications of ChatGPT</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">There is a world of solutions <a id="_idIndexMarker169" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>waiting to be solved. In the space<a id="_idIndexMarker170" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> of enterprise solutions, there are solutions that ChatGPT can help with. Let’s throw out a collection of use cases that can be improved with ChatGPT in the mix. Don’t be shy; ask ChatGPT for suggestions specific to the business. Drill down into detail with it. The process might not highlight what is most important for the company, but generating ideas starts the process. Having an extensive collection of ideas is okay, but use the skills provided to prioritize based on value.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you draw on what others have done with ChatGPT, it is essential to understand if they have done it <em class="italic">well</em>. Here are some areas that ChatGPT can handle. There are thousands of ideas out there worth exploring. Use this to spur some thinking. Rethink these examples into your company’s business and practice. Consider the following ideas<a id="_idIndexMarker171" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to help with a brainstorming session<a id="_idIndexMarker172" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">

			<p class="calibre3">Let’s pull a random company<a id="_idIndexMarker173" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> out of a hat and see the wealth of AI<a id="_idIndexMarker174" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> possibilities. I picked the 2,000th largest company in the world (so we are inclusive of large enterprise companies of many sizes). This search landed on The Gap, an iconic retail organization that sells clothes via many brands, such as Old Navy, The Gap, Athleta, Banana Republic, and Intermix. It is at the end of the Forbes 2000 list of global companies. Let me give an example of how to brainstorm with ChatGPT by generating a prompt to help brainstorm</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Our company is called the Gap; it includes many brands that sell apparel in retail settings in stores worldwide.

			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">We could continue. It did a great job exploring opportunities for ChatGPT. These examples benefit from what ChatGPT is good at. When good enterprise data is passed to an LLM with content and intelligent control via prompting and security, it can deliver value at many customer engagement steps. <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em> explores bringing enterprise data into the fold.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">When doing competitive research, it might be clear that other companies are building similar LLM <a id="_idIndexMarker177" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker178" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>, and it could be a game of catch-up. For example, clothing recommendations will be the norm. A company must have this in the future. In any of these deployments for cloth recommenders, there will be failures. Most failures will come from not caring and feeding the LLM; some will fail because they picked the wrong use case, and a few will fail, likely because LLMs are imperfect. Active monitoring, iterative design, and fine-tuning are staples of success and will help avoid failure. We will take all of <a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines and Heuristics</em> to discuss monitoring to ensure an understanding of success and future improvements. We will draw on these earlier chapters to refine and improve. Stay tuned. I hope we instill the idea that not <em class="italic">every</em> problem is solved with ChatGPT. Focus on the most valuable pieces of a problem that can be delivered sooner.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor068" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Examples of generative AI outside of chat</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Try to think outside of the box. Great ideas<a id="_idIndexMarker179" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> can always come from very different fields. We have Velcro® because an engineer noticed the burrs that clung to his clothes after a walk with his dog (in 1941), Post-it® notes because of a failed attempt by Spencer Silver to create a super-strong adhesive (in 1968), and Super Glue® by Dr. Harry Coover, at Eastman Kodak (in 1942), from a failed attempt to create a clear plastic. So, it is always good to think outside of the box. I always suggest looking at problems in the context of the whole business. Sometimes, we get caught solving issues in the weeds when we need to look up and see the entire forest. As I mentioned with the patching example, sometimes the solution is to remove the UX and automate the whole practice. That is the ultimate simplification. This list of innovations that ChatGPT can address grows every day. However, I put these out here because they might connect experiences and the company’s needs. Innovation<a id="_idIndexMarker180" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> can come from anywhere. Could any of these widely varying spaces help<a id="_idIndexMarker181" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> in a quest for solutions? Let’s see:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Vision analysis of objects for detection, sorting, counting, or analyzing</strong>: Are there inventory, shipping, handling, or retail issues? Amazon has already implemented stores where customers put stuff in shopping bags in their cart (or take it out when they change their mind), the store calculates the cost, and they walk out the door. There is no checking out.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Image creation for the visual arts, marketing, or social media</strong>: Although this space is much bigger than the example, an artist, with prompting, can generate images without licensing issues for media. There might be issues with LLMS training on unlicensed material. Something we will discuss later.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Musical composition</strong>: I am impressed by how ChatGPT calls Mathematica to create a note-for-note melody. I can’t speak to how catchy the jingles might be…</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">System simulation and testing</strong>: It is very trendy to create virtual simulations of processes or building of buildings (we hear the term digital twin), so look to see places to use ChatGPT to simulate or test conditions.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Prototyping and user interface design</strong>: This was the book we should write, but I didn’t think the world was ready for it. Use the models as tools. Someone out there will write this book for us.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Drug discovery</strong>: Google it. If drug companies can search for new compounds based on research and results, I bet a goldmine is in enterprise data. Mine it.</li>
				<li class="calibre8"><strong class="bold">Finding new solutions to age-old problems</strong>: With the right tools and framework, a generative solution can solve problems with unknown answers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">We have plenty of uses<a id="_idIndexMarker182" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> for ChatGPT, but<a id="_idIndexMarker183" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> it will not always be the right solution. Here are some places where ChatGPT might not be the best fit.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor069" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Avoiding ChatGPT limitations, biases, and inappropriate responses</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">A puzzle piece might not fit a puzzle because it is from a different puzzle. We love to take a new tool and apply it to every solution. A hammer has a lot more uses than just pounding nails, but that doesn’t make it the right tool for the job. ChatGPT’s unique ability to predict what to say next will not always fit a specific use case perfectly. There are plenty of spaces where there might not be a good match. Or, as shown in the enterprise patching example, it’s not necessary to apply ChatGPT to every step to get value. Not only should the use cases be the most important, but they should also be ones where ChatGPT integration makes sense. Here are some areas where it might be challenging to apply ChatGPT to a solution and some creative thinking to help if these situations apply.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor070" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Lack of real-time information</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Foundational models have cut-off dates for the ingestion of new material. A new model might have data only from a year prior or earlier. This problem will improve<a id="_idIndexMarker184" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> over time; we have seen the ingested material dates as recent as less than a year. However, if there is a lag and a customer needs that time-critical information, it must provide it. If the company releases a 2.0 widget, new documentation can update a custom model with that information at launch. However, if the LLM solution depends on keeping third-party details up to date, ingesting up-to-date third-party data is also needed. It won’t matter if the third party posts the information on their website since the foundational model won’t be that current. Since the model updates are limited, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), explained in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em> can ingest this data and be up to date. Recognize that new testing and validation are required with changes to the model.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor071" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Complex or specialized topics</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Legal and medical advice<a id="_idIndexMarker185" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> are the two areas that could cause issues. However, many opportunities exist when building enterprise versions of these services. They don’t have to be the answer to the legal or medical questions; they can help refine the space or look for connections that might be too difficult for a human to process (such as possible side effects or interactions for a patient with 15 different medications). A support tool in the legal space could be to review mountains of legal files to highlight information related to specific expertise. Expert witnesses have to review depositions to form their conclusions. Still, with a ChatGPT tool that can be trained, it can identify important information in hundreds of pages of depositions and speed up the process by a factor of 10. It also comes back to the lack of real-time data if it is expected to know everything. Create high-quality solutions by carefully monitoring the quality of the results by experts, incrementally improving, documenting, and refining success.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor072" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Long-form content generation</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">It is common for enterprise use cases to need long-form content, such as writing a book. We have knowledge and technical documentation needs, but this is not an effective use of ChatGPT. ChatGPT can help edit material, shorten tests, tighten language, or even do essential translations, but there are limits. Don’t expect to put out long material like this without technical editors. ChatGPT can drift away from the topic, introduce unrelated content, and repeat phrasing. It might even repeat topics. I have seen good examples where a ten-step guide had two steps labeled slightly differently but identical to earlier steps – creating and maintaining the organization and hierarchy found in complex and lengthy documents taxes the long-term memory limitations of generative AI. Also, facts are not what they used to be. Especially with technical documents, we always have additional testers run through the processes and tasks in the document to verify that the solutions work. ChatGPT might first identify and point the user to the correct pieces of well-authored documents. Then, the user can trust the results to be accurate if they recognize that the document applies to them. For example, we don’t want to show a valid step-by-step solution to the problem in Microsoft Windows when we know they are using an Apple Macintosh.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor073" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Long-term memory</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">A ChatGPT virtual assistant<a id="_idIndexMarker186" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> might be good from one comment to the next, but not for a long duration. A conversation that spans a week will not likely maintain the context or information to continue that conversation. However, some workarounds could be developed. Consider if long-term attributes or the conversation could be saved and processed to remind the LLM of previous discussions. A collection of contextual details could be built up over time. Even a historical list of earlier elements of a conversation could be stored. It is exciting to give an LLM the appearance of long-term memory. Vendors are working on providing foundational models better long-term memory. We have seen this in ChatGPT 4o, for example. Imagine a directory service within a company:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">The directory app provides people’s names, phone numbers, email addresses, and titles.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Many people have asked the app many times. It can look at search history to understand popular people and shortcuts for people’s names (Ben for Benjamin).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">If a user returns a month later, they don’t want to scroll through the history (or maybe the UI doesn’t have this data).</li>
				<li class="calibre8">So, the user asks, “What was <em class="italic">his</em> phone number again?”</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Once the AI responds with a name, the user responds, “No, it was someone else,” and the app returns a short list of other possible names.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">By storing people’s history, it looked up and provided that context in the prompt (or via other solutions). This recreates the history and presents the appearance of long-term memory.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Context about this user and their organization might allow the LLM to provide names that were not previously used but are likely answers. “I don’t see that we talked about Ben before, but maybe you mean Benjamin Buttons. Here are his details…”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Thus, long-term memory could be constructed to provide context to new conversations. Each time it is constructed, we can confirm that the user has permission to access this information. This is one method to protect sensitive information. Sensitive information takes many forms in an enterprise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor074" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Sensitive information</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Understanding what is private and keeping that information confidential is a real challenge. Recall that an LLM doesn’t understand what it is saying; it is good at predicting. We have seen time and time again stories about chat models being forced to spill information that should be sensitive. A workaround is not to use that information directly in the model. For example, if the app needs to collect credit card information, develop a secure service to pass this information between the user and the credit card backend. It doesn’t have to be done within the conversational model. Doing so with a GUI element might support building more trust <a id="_idIndexMarker187" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> with the user. Another place we can build trust and have issues with LLMs is with biased thinking.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor075" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Biased thinking</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The model is only as good as its training data. If the model has biases toward a way of thinking, is harmful to a user group, or contains offensive material, it can have unintended consequences on results. This presumably comes from the base model. Be cautious of this with proprietary data. It might not be a personal or cultural bias, but how a product or a competitor’s products are discussed can impact results. If the foundational model has biases, it might take some engineering to protect users from these using instructions to the LLM. But no matter how good the instructions are, some things are hard to teach, like emotion and empathy.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor076" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Emotion and empathy</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">We discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker188" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the history of <strong class="bold">ELIZA</strong>, the original chatbot, in <a href="B21964_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Recognizing the Power of Design in ChatGPT</em>; thus, using AI for psychological support<a id="_idIndexMarker189" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> is at the root of our AI journey. But be careful here. It lacks empathy and emotional understanding. There may be ways ChatGPT can be used to support the mental health community, but AI is not ready to answer 911 (or 988 mental health) calls (these are the emergency phone numbers in the USA). Use guardrails, test extensively, and monitor results where humans might be in a sensitive state. Even if a conversation with an LLM might be perceived as empathetic, this can go wrong quickly. It is only doing what is likely and not based on the nuances of empathy or emotion. In some sense, it is unethical for the LLM to sound empathetic.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor077" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Ethical and moral guidance</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Most enterprise solutions usually do not delve into ethical or moral dilemmas. Much of this comes back to the Trolley problem when making a decision that can adversely affect two parties. The problem is based on a situation where a runaway trolley is about to kill people near the track, or it can be diverted and kill other people on a second track. How do you make such a decision?</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The Trolly problem</p>
			<p class="callout">This article describes the moral and ethical dilemmas described by the Trolley problem.</p>
			<p class="callout">Wikipedia: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/trolley-problem" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">The Trolly Problem</a> (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/trolley-problem" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.britannica.com/topic/trolley-problem</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Autonomous cars must consider these decisions, so commercially deployed systems already have to handle these hard decisions. ChatGPT is not built to make ethical decisions; it will use its predictive model to form its answer. Traditional machine learning already has this problem, and LLMs are not immune. Most popular models avoid answering ethical questions. Enterprise solutions that need to delve into these areas can be impacted by safeguards built into <a id="_idIndexMarker190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> the models. Carefully apply best practices to prevent these conditions. Related to ethical and moral issues is how to handle critical decisions with significant consequences.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Critical decision making</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">We have talked about ethics, morality, security, and empathy. These might come into play when making time-critical decisions with profound consequences. Depending on business decisions based on the model, and the model has been trained on the diverse internet data, will it give the same conclusions that a trusted expert would provide? It is essential to monitor this interaction closely, train it on company-specific data to avoid biases, and provide guidance and guardrails to the recommendation engine. Remember, it is basing its results on patterns it has seen. <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King</em> covers how ChatGPT works with enterprise data to make the LLM respond with business-savvy knowledge. It isn’t going to answer with a human’s moral compass and is not in a position to decide on the value of its judgment based on the expectations<a id="_idIndexMarker191" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> of its human user. Maybe less challenging would be something more geeky, like programming.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor079" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Programming and debugging</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">This is one area that is getting a tremendous amount of visibility. I think it’s mostly because geeks love geeky things. Also, getting ChatGPT to do work is fantastic. However, if you don’t know what you don’t know, be very careful with its responses. Production-level code requires more robustness than what ChatGPT can provide. LLMs can write test cases against the code the model wrote. It can easily knock out simple scripts and templates in many common languages. And it is not just programming. Different models can be used to generate test cases and give the human in the loop some support. I suspect this area will mature quickly in the next few years. The more it can learn about good patterns and quality code examples, the more critical this area will become. Just know and expect it isn’t perfect. But these programming languages are sometimes better than world languages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor080" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Translation accuracy</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Most models handle translation but are only sometimes successful in technical or scientific areas. The training models have traditionally been very English-centric. Since they were trained on available web resources and 55% to 60% of the web is in English, the sophistication of translations varies considerably based on the training available.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are significant hurdles to overcome for technical and company-specific vocabulary. Test and verify how these terms might be handled in other languages or used without translation. Test and verify cases of multiple languages being used in one interaction. Additionally, brand names <a id="_idIndexMarker192" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> are translated into only some cultures.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Speaking the user’s language has so much value. We have a UX saying to <em class="italic">bring the tool to the user, don’t make the user go to the tool</em>. Translating languages is the same. Customers would appreciate working in their native tongue rather than forgoing support or communicating in another language. The quality of the language mirrors the training available. Expect better support for Spanish, French, and German, while it can be challenged in Russian, Arabic, and Hindi, especially with idiomatic dialects, formalities, and technical language. Again, monitor results and invest in training technical jargon and unique company vocabulary. Some world languages have smaller training sets, grammar, syntax, and phonetics complexities, overlaps or confusion with another language, and a limited human feedback loop. There is no substitute for a great teacher.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor081" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Educational substitution</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Human trainers and training or educational material have a long history of success (and failure) in various areas. The best class I have ever taken was a three-day hands-on class in the 100-degree heat of the desert. We rarely sat down, and even with ten years of college, I learned more per hour than in <a id="_idIndexMarker193" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> any classroom. Don’t expect ChatGPT to have the expertise to train or educate students effectively. It doesn’t know how the student reacts and will be challenged to adapt to their needs. Hands-on skill training is difficult and even more challenging (but not impossible) to analyze and share with an LLM. For example, a training application might teach and coach how to change out a faulty sensor on an airplane engine. The LLM can coach the user, while cameras can detect the situation and guide the user to perform the steps in the correct order, point to the right tool (using a laser pointer), and identify the location to apply the tool. Assisted maintenance is a vast area, and given the cost of mistakes, investments in this space will be significant. So, it is coming, but it will be hard, and accuracy will be critical.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor082" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Don’t force-fit a solution</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Recognize that for every bottleneck to which ChatGPT is applied, ChatGPT might offer suggestions on how to avoid or mitigate issues. However, don’t try to force-fit ChatGPT into a solution. There seems to be a rich set of opportunities to apply ChatGPT in almost any vertical market. Focus on the use cases that provide the most value and match the unique capabilities of a generative AI solution.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">ChatGPT might be used in a space not covered in this book. Try asking it, reviewing it, and diving deeper into its response:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
What problems would ChatGPT have with identifying legal challenges if I gave you a collection of depositions to review?
What issues would ChatGPT have with providing a summary of knowledge articles on resolving complex technical problems with airplane engine repair?</pre>			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor083" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Developing user stories can sometimes be easy. If requirements are apparent, straightforward, and ideally suited to ChatGPT, write those up and get to work. We also realize that some things need to be clarified. Use research, discussions with internal stakeholders, and your keen mind for problem-solving to find LLM opportunities.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Start thinking about the opportunities best suited for a generative solution in your business and explain why some problems are unsuitable for ChatGPT.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Hopefully, this chapter will create excitement around introducing our next topic for scoring and prioritizing stories. We will jump into that next since we only briefly explained User Needs Scoring. This will allow us to prioritize the backlog features and use cases we have explored up to this point. It will also be helpful to know this when we get a ChatGPT solution up and running and want to test or monitor it.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Once we have a solution, we can reuse some of these skills to verify what we did and continue to care for and feed the solution for continuous improvement. We will then have data and some confidence that we are doing the right things.</p>
