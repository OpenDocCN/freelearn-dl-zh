			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Understanding Code References</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following <span class="No-Break">key topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are <span class="No-Break">code references?</span></li>
				<li>Enabling, disabling, and opting out of <span class="No-Break">code references</span></li>
				<li>Code <span class="No-Break">reference example</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter will be a short one, but the topic deserves its own chapter so that it’s not skipped over. So, let’s get straight <span class="No-Break">into it.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>What are code references?</h1>
			<p>Development introduces innovative<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> solutions; however, it also brings the responsibility of adhering to licensing requirements and ensuring proper attribution. Failing to comply with open source licenses can lead to legal and ethical issues, potentially compromising the integrity of the entire project. Therefore, it is crucial for developers to accurately identify and manage any open source code used in <span class="No-Break">their projects.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Open source software license</p>
			<p class="callout">The topic of open source licensing is <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>quite broad, with open source software being distributed under various licenses, each having different requirements and permissions. In this chapter, we will not go into the details of the types of open source licenses and their legalities. We encourage all users of open source software to conduct their due diligence in understanding and complying with the <span class="No-Break">applicable licenses.</span></p>
			<p>During its learning process, Amazon Q Developer sometimes uses open source projects for training purposes. Occasionally, its suggestions might closely resemble specific pieces of the training data. Amazon Q flags code suggestions that may resemble publicly available code. This enables developers to review the open source project repository URL and its license, ensuring responsible integration of open source code by properly adding the necessary <span class="No-Break">license attribution.</span></p>
			<p>Using the reference log, you can view code recommendations that are similar to the training data. Additionally, you <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>can update and edit the code recommendations provided by <span class="No-Break">Amazon Q.</span></p>
			<p>Before we understand code references with an example, let’s quickly look at how to enable or disable code references and, if needed, completely opt out <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Enabling, disabling, and opting out of code references</h1>
			<p>Turning code<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> references on and off is straightforward. Different IDEs or tools that enable<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> the use of Amazon Q Developer have an enable/disable flag in the Amazon Q settings. For example, if you use VS Code, you can click the <strong class="bold">Open Settings</strong> page from the Amazon Q preferences option at the bottom <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>of <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights this in the VS <span class="No-Break">Code IDE.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – Amazon Q Developer – Settings</p>
			<p>Once you open the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page, you<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> can find the checkbox that allows you to enable and disable code suggestions with the code references option, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>

			<p>Similarly, the option to enable/disable <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>code references is available in other IDEs and AWS tools where Amazon Q can be integrated. For example, the following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Code with references</strong> toggle switch available in an AWS Glue <span class="No-Break">Studio notebook.</span></p>

				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer193">

			<p>CodeWhisperer, shown in the screenshot, is the old name before it was rebranded as Amazon Q Developer. If you want to understand how to enable and disable it for other IDEs or tools, such as the ones we discussed back in <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, follow the link provided in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> the end of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Sometimes, administrators of organizations may want all developers to opt out of code references. This can be done from the Amazon Q console settings page, where only the administrator has the privilege to opt out of this setting at the <span class="No-Break">enterprise level.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the opt-out setting in the Amazon Q console settings page. To opt in again for all developers, the flag just needs to be set <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">True</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>Now let’s see code references in action with an example in the VS <span class="No-Break">Code IDE.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Code reference example</h1>
			<p>Consider that you<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> are building a project that utilizes Amazon DynamoDB as a NoSQL database. Throughout the project, you need to create a DynamoDB table in Python. So, you open an IDE that supports Amazon Q Developer; in our case, we are using <span class="No-Break">VS Code.</span></p>
			<p>In the IDE, we input a prompt to create a function, allowing Amazon Q to auto-generate the code for us to create a DynamoDB table. As soon as we begin typing the function, the auto-suggestion from Amazon Q Developer not only provides us with the code suggestion but also gives us the code reference, indicating at the top that this code sample was from MIT-licensed <span class="No-Break">training data.</span></p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, we have highlighted this code reference provided by <span class="No-Break">Amazon Q.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer195">
					<img alt="Figure 11.5 – Amazon Q Developer – code references" src="image/B21378_11_5.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.5 – Amazon Q Developer – code references</p>
			<p>Now, keep in mind that code references don’t show up often. They only appear when a particular code suggestion<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> provided by Amazon Q comes from the training data it used during its learning period. So, it’s not easy to replicate it every time, as different instances of recommendations may not always be picked up based on what was used in <span class="No-Break">the training.</span></p>
			<p>To facilitate understanding of all code references used throughout the project, the code reference log will keep a tally so that you can analyze and make informed actions based on its appropriate usage. The <strong class="bold">CODE REFERENCE LOG</strong> panel in the IDE will display all the <span class="No-Break">code references.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights this in the VS <span class="No-Break">Code IDE.</span></p>

			<p>Other IDEs and AWS tools also<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> have a similar mechanism to track code references. A complete list of how to view code references provided by Amazon Q Developer in other tools can be found in the link in the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">References</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
			<p>This brings an end to this short but important chapter on <span class="No-Break">code references.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered what code references are and why they are important. We then looked at how you can enable and disable code references from different IDEs and tools that support Amazon Q Developer. Administrators of the AWS account can also opt out of code references, so organizations can control whether they want developers to view and apply code references in <span class="No-Break">their code.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, with the help of an example, we showed how code references appear in the IDE as Amazon Q Developer makes a code suggestion that happened to have been used during its training. All code references are also logged in the code reference log for ease <span class="No-Break">of analysis.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will walk you through a few more very important features of Amazon Q Developer that significantly save time and boost the productivity <span class="No-Break">of developers.</span></p>
