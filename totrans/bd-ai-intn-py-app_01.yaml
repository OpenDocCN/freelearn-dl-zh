    The landscape is, quite frankly, overwhelming to navigate, and many of the tools
    that satisfy one criterion may fall short in another. GenAI applications evolve
    so quickly that within weeks of this book being published, some of the new AI
    companies might no longer exist. Therefore, this chapter focuses on long-lived,
    high-level concepts related to technologies that are used to create GenAI applications.

    This chapter will examine not just *what* these ways are but *how* they work,

    help you decide when to use GenAI and how, as well as make the applications you
    create generally more accurate.

    demands more computational power, OpenAI ensures that you can scale effortlessly
    without worrying about the underlying hardware or system architecture. OpenAI’s

    but that the world’s data is fundamentally relational. It can be argued that no
    data is meaningful until humans deem it so, and that the relationships and structure
    of that data are determined by humans as well. For example, several years ago,
    a researcher at a leading space exploration company made this memorable comment
    in a meeting:'

    real world—`.txt` files, Markdown, PDFs, HTML, and so on. MongoDB is flexible
    enough to have the structure that engineers deem is best suited for purpose, and
    because of that flexibility, it is a great fit for GenAI use cases.

- en: Another reason to use MongoDB is for its vector search capabilities. **Vector
    search** ensures that when you store a phrase in MongoDB, it converts that data
    into an array. This is called a vector. **Vectors** are numerical representations
    of data and their context, as shown in *Figure 1**.3*. The number of these dimensions
    is referred to as an **embedding**, and the more of them you have, the better
    off you are.

- en: After you’ve created embeddings for a piece of data, a mathematical process
    will identify which vectors are closest or nearest to each other, and you can
    then infer that the data is related. This allows you to return related words instead
    of only exact matches. For instance, if you are looking for `pets`, you could
    find `cats`, `dogs`, `parakeets`, and `hamsters`—even though those terms are not
    the exact word `pets`. Vectors are what allow you to receive results that are
    related in meaning or context or are alike, without being an exact match.

    together makes the consequent queries faster. It is easiest to visualize vector
    search via an example with explanations of how it works along the way. You will

    illustrators who make their living off their craft. There are questions about
    whether using AI to write a book gives a person the right to call themselves an
    author. There are no clear-cut answers here; from our own experience, the authors
    of this book believe that GenAI accelerates, rather than replaces, the existing
