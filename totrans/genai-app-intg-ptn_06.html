<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-68">Integration Pattern: Batch Summarization</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>explore the application of <strong class="keyWord">Generative AI</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GenAI</strong>) to summarize documents, an invaluable capability across industries. However, before delving into a specific use case, it’s essential to recognize that search intelligence powered by GenAI supports multiple use cases beyond document summarization. These include test case generation, document search supporting text, audio, and video-based data, as well as various analysis business use cases. Our focus, however, will be on a compelling use case within the financial services sector, where document summarization can streamline processes and enhance regulatory compliance efforts.</p>
<p class="normal">To illustrate this use case, let’s consider a scenario where a financial services company is faced with the daunting task of reviewing a high volume of client applications. These applications often span multiple pages and encompass a wide range of information, including personal details, financial history, investment goals, and risk profiles.</p>
<p class="normal">Manually reviewing and distilling the key points from each application can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially when dealing with a large influx of submissions. This is where GenAI-driven summarization can be a game-changer, enabling efficient extraction of the most salient information while ensuring regulatory compliance by providing the ability not only to summarize but also to follow guidelines about what aspects to focus on, providing an elevated experience.</p>
<p class="normal">By leveraging GenAI models’ natural language understanding and generation capabilities, companies can develop a system that intelligently analyzes regulatory documents, identifies the critical details, and generates concise summaries. </p>
<p class="normal">These summaries can then be seamlessly integrated into downstream processes, such as risk assessment, portfolio construction, or client onboarding workflows.</p>
<p class="normal">It is important to note that this use case is not intended to replace the work of a compliance officer but to enhance them through GenAI while optimizing their work in terms of quality and efficiency.</p>
<p class="normal">The chapter will build on the example by referring to the GenAI integration framework proposed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Generative AI Batch and Real-time Integration Patterns</em>. It starts by defining the use case of summarizing client applications in the financial services industry to streamline processes and enhance regulatory compliance efforts. It then proposes a cloud-native, serverless architecture on Google Cloud for batch processing these client applications.</p>
<p class="normal">We will then <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>delve into the entry point of the pipeline, which is an object created in <strong class="keyWord">Google Cloud Storage</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GCS</strong>), triggering a cloud function to initiate the summarization process. It emphasizes the importance of prompt pre-processing, incorporating domain-specific knowledge and compliance guidelines into the prompts.</p>
<p class="normal">We will cover the inference phase, where the tailored prompts and client application content are submitted to Google Gemini on Vertex AI to generate concise summaries. </p>
<p class="normal">We’ll discuss the result post-processing, ingesting the summaries into a database, and various approaches for presenting the summaries, such as dedicated applications or integration with existing systems. We’ll also provide the sample code for implementing the proposed solution on Google Cloud.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-69">Use case definition</h1>
<p class="normal">In this example use case, we will work on a 10-K form summarization use case. The 10-K form aims to <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>provide transparency into the company’s financial health, operations, and risk factors for investors and regulators. The details can span hundreds of pages for large, complex companies.</p>
<p class="normal">Summarizing the extensive 10-K annual filings from public companies can unlock significant value for financial services firms. These lengthy documents, often spanning hundreds of pages, contain critical information about a company’s business operations, financial performance, risk factors, and strategies. However, manually analyzing these filings is an extremely time-consuming and inefficient process. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities to generate concise summaries of 10-Ks, financial institutions can accelerate their analysis while ensuring consistent extraction of the most pertinent details. These summaries provide investment professionals with quick access to key financial metrics, competitive insights, potential risks, and future outlooks, enabling more informed investment decisions and portfolio monitoring.</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, summarized 10-Ks can be seamlessly integrated into existing research workflows, regulatory compliance processes, and decision support systems within financial firms. This automated approach enhances scalability, allowing analysts to process large <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>volumes of filings rapidly. It also mitigates the risk of human error or oversight that can occur during manual analysis. Consequently, financial services companies can leverage AI-driven 10-K summarization to gain a competitive edge through optimized investment analysis, improved risk management practices, and better-informed capital allocation strategies – ultimately contributing to enhanced returns and operational efficiency across their businesses.</p>
<p class="normal">Manually reviewing these forms can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially when dealing with a large volume of forms. Financial services professionals must carefully analyze each section, identify the key information, and ensure that the client’s needs and risk profiles are accurately understood.</p>
<p class="normal">By leveraging a GenAI-driven approach to summarization, financial institutions can streamline various manual processes, extracting the most salient information from each form while adhering to regulatory compliance standards. The summaries can then enable financial advisors and portfolio managers to quickly grasp the client’s situation and make informed decisions. The following diagram captures this by explaining the different components that will be used when designing the prompt.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" height="500" src="../Images/B22175_06_01.png" width="432"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.1: 10-K summarization prompt generation diagram</p>
<p class="normal">Furthermore, these summaries can be seamlessly integrated into downstream processes, such as risk assessment, portfolio construction, or client onboarding workflows, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors.</p>
<p class="normal">Compliance officers <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>can also benefit from GenAI-driven summarization by incorporating specific rules and guidelines into the prompts. For example, the summarization model can be instructed to highlight potential red flags, such as inconsistencies in financial information or discrepancies between stated risk tolerance and investment objectives. By surfacing these issues promptly, compliance teams can proactively address them, ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and mitigating potential risks.</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, the summaries generated by GenAI models can serve as a valuable reference point for future client interactions, enabling financial advisors to quickly review the client’s situation and provide personalized advice or recommendations, ultimately leading to improved client experiences and stronger relationships.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-70">Architecture</h1>
<p class="normal">Building upon the architecture discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Integration Pattern: Batch Metadata Extraction,</em> for the first batch processing example, we will adopt a similar cloud-native, serverless approach on Google Cloud to handle the batch processing of client applications <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>for summarization. This scalable setup leverages various services, allowing us to seamlessly integrate the AI model and store the generated summaries.</p>
<p class="normal">The architecture will consist of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Object store</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Google Cloud Storage</strong>): This highly scalable and durable object store <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>will be used to store client applications, which can be in various formats, such as PDFs, Word documents, or structured data files.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Messaging queue</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Google Cloud Pub/Sub</strong>): A messaging queue will be employed <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>to coordinate the data flow and manage the processing of client applications.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Processing component</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Google Cloud Functions</strong>): Cloud Functions will serve as <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>the processing component, executing the summarization tasks and invoking the LLM.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">LLM </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">Google Gemini</strong>): We <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>will leverage a powerful LLM, such as Google Gemini, hosted on Vertex AI to perform the actual summarization.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Database</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Google BigQuery</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Cloud Firestore</strong>): The generated summaries will <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>be stored in a structured format, in either a relational database (BigQuery) or a document database (Cloud Firestore), depending on the specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The interactions between these components are represented in the following diagram:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" height="324" src="../Images/B22175_06_02.png" width="825"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.2: Batch summarization use case architecture diagram</p>
<p class="normal">Here’s a <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>breakdown of the flow of the architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Client applications are uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, triggering a cloud function as soon as the documents are in the bucket.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The cloud function reads the list of applications from Cloud Storage and publishes messages to a Pub/Sub topic, effectively creating a queue of applications to be processed.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Another cloud function, subscribed to the Pub/Sub topic, is triggered for each message tied to a given application in the queue.</li>
<li class="numberedList">This second cloud function invokes the LLM (for example, Google Gemini) hosted on Vertex AI, passing the application content as input along with a tailored prompt.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The LLM processes the application, leveraging its natural language understanding capabilities to generate a concise summary while adhering to any specified rules or guidelines.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The generated summary is then stored in a structured format (for example, BigQuery or Cloud Firestore) for further analysis, integration, and consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">This serverless architecture provides several benefits, including automatic scaling, cost-efficiency (pay-per-use pricing), and seamless integration with other Google Cloud services. Additionally, it allows easy integration with existing workflows, enabling financial institutions to leverage GenAI-driven summarization without significant disruptions to their existing processes.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-71">Entry point</h2>
<p class="normal">Similar to the previous chapter, the entry point for our batch processing pipeline will be an object <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>created in <strong class="keyWord">Google Cloud Storage</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GCS</strong>). As <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>client applications are uploaded to a designated GCS bucket, a cloud function will be triggered, initiating the summarization process.</p>
<p class="normal">For this use case, we will leverage the powerful capabilities of Google Gemini, a state-of-the-art GenAI model renowned for its natural language understanding and generation abilities. Gemini will analyze the uploaded client application, intelligently extracting the most salient information and generating a concise summary.</p>
<p class="normal">To ensure regulatory compliance and adherence to specific guidelines, we will incorporate rules and instructions into the prompt provided to Gemini. These rules may include highlighting potential red flags, ensuring consistency between stated risk tolerance and investment objectives, or emphasizing specific sections of the application based on compliance requirements.</p>
<p class="normal">By combining Gemini’s advanced reasoning capabilities with tailored prompts and rules, we can generate summaries that not only capture the essence of the client’s application but also facilitate efficient review and decision-making processes while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-72">Prompt pre-processing</h2>
<p class="normal">We will start by crafting an effective prompt to guide the GenAI model in generating accurate <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>and compliant summaries. In this case, we will leverage insights from compliance officers and subject matter experts within the financial services industry to understand the critical information that needs to be captured in the summaries.</p>
<p class="normal">It is important to remark that the intent behind this prompt is to provide an example of what compliance guidelines may look like, but in no way does this represent a real-world compliance example nor is it intended to be used to analyze business profiles.</p>
<p class="normal">Based on these insights, we will develop a template or a set of guidelines that outline the key sections and data points to be included in the summaries. This template will serve as a foundation for our prompt, ensuring that the summaries generated by the GenAI model align with the specific requirements of the financial services company.</p>
<p class="normal">Additionally, we will incorporate rules and guidelines provided by compliance officers to ensure that <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>the summaries adhere to relevant regulations and industry best practices. These rules may include instructions for highlighting potential discrepancies, inconsistencies, or areas of concern that require further review or investigation.</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, when designing our prompt and incorporating domain-specific knowledge and compliance guidelines, we can leverage the power of GenAI to generate summaries that are not only concise and accurate but also provide insights related to compliance and regulatory requirements, ultimately streamlining the application review process while reducing potential risks.</p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-73">Inference</h2>
<p class="normal">For the inference phase, we will submit our prompt, along with the client application content, to the <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>Google Gemini model available through Vertex AI. The Vertex AI platform provides a robust and scalable environment for deploying and managing GenAI models, ensuring high performance and enterprise-grade security.</p>
<p class="normal">In our example, we are using an example dataset of companies that signed up for our fictional financial services company. The inference code will work on the whole dataset, with delays to prevent consuming the available quota. Depending on your cloud provider or setup, you may have different inference quotas, which are generally related to <strong class="keyWord">QPS</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">queries per second</strong>) or <strong class="keyWord">QPM</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">queries per minute</strong>). In our example, we have a 6 QPM limit.</p>
<p class="normal">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>code snippet populates an array with the result <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>text content. This can be further customized to evaluate safety attributes, for example, or to deal with empty results. For example, in the case of empty results, you could flag the doc and send it to a queue for further processing.</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> time

  time.sleep(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
  summaries.append(result.text)
  <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(result.text)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">When <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>thinking about a more complex inference pipeline, we need to focus on the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">The cloud function, triggered by the arrival of a new client application in GCS, retrieves the application content and the tailored prompt.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The cloud function invokes the Gemini model on Vertex AI, passing the application content and prompt as input.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Gemini processes the application, leveraging its natural language understanding capabilities to generate a concise summary while adhering to the specified rules and guidelines outlined in the prompt.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The generated summary is returned to the cloud function for further processing and storage.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">By leveraging the power of Gemini and the scalability of Vertex AI, we can efficiently process large volumes of client applications, generating accurate and compliant summaries in a timely manner.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-74">Result post-processing</h2>
<p class="normal">Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>LLM has processed the client applications, it will return the summaries in a structured format, such as JSON or a markup language. The next step in our pipeline is to ingest these summaries into a database for efficient storage and retrieval.</p>
<p class="normal">The specific ingestion strategy will depend on the database type we choose to employ. For example, if we opt for a relational database like BigQuery, we will need to map the summary data points to appropriate table structures, ensuring proper normalization and adherence to data integrity principles.</p>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, if we decide to use a document database like Cloud Firestore, the ingestion process will be more straightforward, as these databases are designed to store hierarchical data structures natively. In this case, we can directly ingest the summaries in their <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>original format, leveraging the database’s ability to efficiently store and query complex data structures.</p>
<p class="normal">Regardless of the database type chosen, it is crucial to design an ingestion strategy that ensures data consistency, scalability, and performance. This may involve implementing strategies such as bulk ingestion, indexing, and partitioning to optimize the database’s performance and ensure efficient retrieval of the summaries.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-75">Result presentation</h2>
<p class="normal">When it comes to presenting the summaries generated from client applications, several factors <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>need to be considered, including the target audience, the intended use case, and the integration with existing systems and workflows.</p>
<p class="normal">One approach is to develop a dedicated application or dashboard that allows financial advisors, portfolio managers, and compliance officers to easily access and review the summaries. This application could provide features such as filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities, enabling users to quickly locate and analyze summaries based on specific criteria, such as client risk profiles, investment goals, or potential red flags identified by the GenAI model.</p>
<p class="normal">Additionally, the application could offer visualization tools to present the summary data in a more intuitive and visually appealing manner. For example, charts and graphs could be used to depict the client’s financial profile, risk tolerance, and investment objectives, providing financial advisors with a comprehensive overview at a glance.</p>
<p class="normal">Another <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>approach is to integrate the summaries directly into existing <strong class="keyWord">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CRM</strong>) systems or client onboarding workflows. This integration would allow financial advisors and compliance officers to access the summaries seamlessly within the tools and platforms they already use, minimizing disruptions to their existing processes.</p>
<p class="normal">Furthermore, the summaries could be leveraged for automation and decision support purposes. For instance, rules-based systems or machine learning models could be trained to analyze the summaries and provide recommendations or risk assessments, further enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the client onboarding and portfolio management processes.</p>
<p class="normal">Regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>of the presentation approach chosen, it is essential to ensure that the summaries are presented in a secure and compliant manner, adhering to industry regulations and data privacy standards. Access controls and authorization mechanisms should be implemented <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>to ensure that sensitive client information is only accessible to authorized personnel.</p>
<p class="normal">On the GitHub directory for this chapter, you will find the complete code and an analysis of how all the pieces described in this chapter fit together. Pay special attention to how every component of the framework interacts with each other.</p>
