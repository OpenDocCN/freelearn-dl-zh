- en: This part focuses on the most technical part of LLM design, the work done in
    the LLM, or when using other tools and techniques to make an end-to-end LLM solution.
    We will start by introducing practices such as **Retrieval Augmented Generation**
    (**RAG**) to integrate enterprise datasets with the generative ability of an LLM.
    You’ll then learn about the fundamentals of prompt engineering for enterprise
    applications. The examples follow a non-technical route, so you can get the most
    out of learning about the steps involved without coding. We’ll then explore fine-tuning
    to make models think and act based on examples provided that will follow the style
    and tone needed for any business or enterprise. We’ll also explore a few case
    studies and give some hands-on experiences to get a feel for the process.
