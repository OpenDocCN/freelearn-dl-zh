     I am thrilled that you have chosen me and my book as your guide on this sometimes intimidating journey into the realm of AI programming.
    
    
     Rest assured that I am committed to making this experience as easy and enjoyable
    
    
     
      as possible.

   <p>
    
     Throughout this book, you will acquire the skills required to create Unreal Engine games that involve the use of AI techniques and learn how to handle them at runtime.
    
    
     We will start from the basics, such as moving agents within a game level, and gradually progress to more advanced topics such as creating complex behaviors and managing multiple AI entities (even dozens or hundreds).
    
    
     By the end of this journey, you will be proficient in crafting formidable opponents that will challenge your players; what’s more, you will possess a deep understanding of the potential pitfalls in AI development and how to
    
    
     
      avoid them.

     the exciting world of AI in game development, I want to kindly remind you that this book is designed for individuals who already possess some knowledge about working with Unreal Engine.
    
    
     Therefore, you must be already familiar with the
    
    
     
      following topics:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">

       and workflow.

       this book.

    <li>
     <strong class="bold">

     </strong>
     
      : As this book focuses on game development, it is assumed that you have some programming experience.
     
     
      Ideally, you should be familiar at least with the Unreal Engine visual scripting system (
     
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Blueprints
      
     </strong>
     
      ) and, to some extent,
     
     
      
       with C++.

     If you are new to Unreal Engine, I highly recommend exploring some introductory books or resources to familiarize yourself with its fundamentals.
    
    
     One amazing starting point is

      with Blueprints.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this book, and whenever possible, I will be showing you techniques by using both Blueprints and C++.
    
    
     If you need a gentle introduction to C++, at the end of this book, you will find a valuable appendix that delves into the intricacies of C++ programming in the context of Unreal Engine.
    
    
     This quick guide is also designed to provide you with some understanding of how C++ works within the Unreal
    
    
     
      Engine framework.

     Although limited, these systems are relatively easy to implement and manage because the knowledge encoded in the rules is modular, and the rules can be coded in any order.
    
    
     This provides much flexibility in both coding and modifying
