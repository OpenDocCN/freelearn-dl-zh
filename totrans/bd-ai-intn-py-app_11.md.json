["```py\nI assess the context of your question. For instance, if you've mentioned the setting (formal or informal), the relationship with the coworker, or any specific preferences, I take those into account.\nIf we've interacted before, I consider any speech patterns or preferences you've shown in previous conversations. This helps tailor the response to your style and needs.\nI use general knowledge about cultural and social norms to gauge what might be most appropriate. For example, formal greetings are more suitable in professional settings, while casual greetings work better in relaxed environments.\n```", "```py\nPredict the average stock price for $TSLA in May 2024.\n```", "```py\nThe average stock price for $TSLA in May 2024 is expected to be $176.\n```", "```py\nPredict the average annual price for $TSLA in 2024.\n```", "```py\nThe average annual stock price for $TSLA in May 2024 is predicted to be $205.\n```", "```py\nWhat is the average stock price for $TSLA in May 2024?\n```", "```py\nThe average stock price for $TSLA in May 2024 is expected to be $176.\n```", "```py\nwhat is the latest version of python\n```", "```py\nThe latest stable version of Python is 3.12.4, released on June 6, 2024\\.
