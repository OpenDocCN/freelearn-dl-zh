			<p>n8n enables users to connect different systems and cloud services without needing expensive developers or technical skillsets. It allows you to reduce the time required to develop new products, helping you bring them to the market quicker than if you had to muster a whole development team.</p>
			<p>Developers working with n8n will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to building low-code applications. The book takes a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up and running and productive in no time.</p>
			<p>You will begin by learning about where n8n fits in the tech stack of your business and how it provides opportunities for reducing costs as well as increasing efficiency and revenue. Later, you will identify opportunities where you can leverage n8n's connectivity and automation functionality within your working environment and progress to building out an n8n-based toolset that will immediately have a positive effect on your operation's bottom line.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to identify real-world opportunities to generate income, improve efficiency, and build tools to capitalize on those opportunities.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for web developers and low-code enthusiasts who have basic knowledge of the JavaScript programming language and web concepts such as APIs and webhooks. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of JavaScript programming.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17493_01_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">, Introduction to No Code, n8n, and Bubble</em>, is where you will gain an understanding of no code and why it is becoming important to business and technology. You will also become familiar with n8n, a no code automation tool, and Bubble, a no-code development platform. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_02_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Using the Editor UI to Create Workflows</em>, teaches you how to use n8n's Editor UI. You will also learn about the different kinds of nodes in n8n and how to use them. You will then learn about workflows, deal with dynamic data, and finally create your first workflow in n8n. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_03_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Diving into Core Nodes and Data in n8n,</em> is where you will learn how to use n8n's data structure to manipulate and transform data inside workflows, and use JavaScript inside your low-code workflows to unlock custom functionalities. You'll call REST APIs from inside your workflows using the HTTP Request node. The chapter will also cover how to handle real-time events using the Webhook node and how to trigger workflows based on this data. You'll work with arrays and JSON objects inside n8n, understand when to use what kind of data format, and transform data inside your workflows. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_04_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Learn by Doing: Building Two n8n Apps</em>, shows you how to combine concepts from the previous chapters and use them to build multiple projects. Some of these projects will reinforce the concepts you learned earlier and others will introduce some new ideas. This will help you understand the kind of products that you can build using n8n. Finally, you will learn how to share and discover new workflows as well as participate in n8n's active community. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_05_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Building Your First API Endpoints</em>, will see you create blueprints for an API endpoint so that there's minimal friction when building the API; you'll also configure the Webhook node so that it can handle requests sent to the API and reply to them. You'll build an API endpoint in n8n based on the blueprints that you created earlier, and you'll secure your API endpoints by using the different authentication methods available in the Webhook node. Later, you'll also test your API to make sure that all the functionalities that you implemented work as expected. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_06_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Powering Your API with a No Code Database, </em>shows you how to work with no-code databases for data storage. You will learn about no-code databases, selecting a database for your project, and reading and writing to Airtable. You will also learn about some of the best practices when working with these databases. The concepts covered in this chapter will help you to use a data store for your projects to store user-generated data and build a complete product. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_07_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Transforming Your Data inside a Workflow</em>, explores how to manipulate data within workflows so that the APIs that you create can return data in a useful format. You will also learn about sharing data between workflows, working with arrays and JSON objects, merging datasets, and performing analytics and calculations. </p>
			<p><a href="B17493_08_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor155"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Utilizing the Bubble API in n8n</em>, looks at how to communicate between Bubble and n8n, access Bubble's data using the Data API, use Bubble's workflows and interact with them using the Workflow API, and receive events and data from Bubble in n8n.</p>
			<p><a href="B17493_09_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor180"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><em class="italic">, Building the User Interface of the Application</em>, dives into how to design responsive applications using the Bubble graphical user interface and how the look and feel of an application can change the user experience. You'll learn about underlying data structures and how to guide users to enter appropriate data into data structures. You'll discover how to identify errors in applications and workflows and proactively handle how errors are presented to users. Finally, you'll design a logging system to capture events and errors and analyze data captured in logs for application improvement.</p>
			<p><a href="B17493_10_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor204"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, We've Only Just Begun</em>, is where you'll see how far you've come in such a short period of time! In this last chapter, you'll have a look at what you learned from the book and get some help in finding and starting that next n8n project!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Depending on the version that you are presently using, you may notice that what is on your screen may look a bit different than what is in the book. As we were nearing the end of the book, n8n updated their user interface, which explains why the examples here are different. With that being said, the scripts all continue to work exactly the same as described in the book and should work just fine for you.</p>
