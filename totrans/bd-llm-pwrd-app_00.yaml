    to and deep dive into LLMs, a powerful set of deep learning neural networks in
    the domain of generative AI. It introduces the concept of LLMs, their differentiators
    from classical machine learning models, and the relevant jargon. It also discusses
    the architecture of the most popular LLMs, moving on to explore how LLMs are trained
    and consumed and compare base LLMs with fine-tuned LLMs. By the end of this chapter,
    you will have the foundations of what LLMs are and their positioning in the landscape
    of AI, creating the basis for the subsequent chapters.'

    the world of software development, leading to a new era of AI-powered applications.
    By the end of this chapter, you will have a clearer picture of how LLMs can be
    embedded in different application scenarios, with the help of new AI orchestrator
    frameworks that are currently available in the AI development market.'

    LLMs may have different architectures, sizes, training data, capabilities, and
    limitations. Choosing the right LLM for your application is not a trivial decision
    as it can significantly impact the performance, quality, and cost of your solution.
    In this chapter, we will navigate the process of choosing the right LLM for your
    application. We will discuss the most promising LLMs in the market, the main criteria
    and tools to use when comparing LLMs, and the various trade-offs between size
    and performance. By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear understanding
    of how to choose the right LLM for your application and how to use it effectively
    and responsibly.'

    activity while designing LLM-powered applications since prompts have a massive
    impact on the performance of LLMs. In fact, there are several techniques that
    can be implemented to not only to refine your LLM’s responses but also reduce
    risks associated with hallucination and biases. In this chapter, we will cover
    the emerging techniques in the field of prompt engineering, from basic approaches
    up to advanced frameworks. By the end of this chapter, you will have the foundations
    to build functional and solid prompts for your LLM-powered applications, which

    of components introduced into the landscape of software development with the advent
    of developing applications with LLMs. To make it easier to orchestrate LLMs and
    their related components in an application flow, several AI frameworks have emerged,
    of which LangChain is one of the most widely used. In this chapter, we will take
    a deep dive into LangChain and how to use it, and learn how to call open-source
    LLM APIs into code via Hugging Face Hub and manage prompt engineering. By the

    LLMs: the ability to handle structured, tabular data. We will see how, with plug-ins
    and an agentic approach, we can use LLMs as a natural language interface between
    us and our structured data, reducing the gap between the business user and the
    structured information. To demonstrate this, we will build a database copilot
    with LangChain. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to build your own
    natural language interface for your data estate, combining unstructured with structured
    sources.'

    working with programming languages. In the previous chapter, we’ve already seen
    a glimpse of this capability, when we asked our LLM to generate SQL queries against
    a SQL Database. In this chapter, we are going to examine in which other ways LLMs
    can be used with code, from “simple” code understanding and generation to the
    building of applications that behave as if they were an algorithm. By the end
    of this chapter, you will be able to build LLM-powered applications for your coding
    projects, as well as build LLM-powered applications with natural language interfaces

    introducing the concept of multi-modality while building agents. We will see the
    logic behind the combination of foundation models in different AI domains – language,
    images, audio – into one single agent that can adapt to a variety of tasks. You
    will learn how to build a multi-modal agent with single-modal LLMs using LangChain.

    Python and Hugging Face. We will delve into how you can prepare your data to fine-tune
    a base model on your data, as well as discuss hosting strategies for your fine-tuned
    model. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to fine-tune an LLM on your
    own data so that you can build domain-specific applications powered by that LLM.'

    new set of risks and biases to be taken into account while developing LLM-powered
    applications.'
