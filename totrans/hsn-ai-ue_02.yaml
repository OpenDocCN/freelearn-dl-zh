    higher order logics, in which some true (or false) statements are unprovable.
    This made first-order logic a good candidate to automate derived logical consequences.

    proved hard to scale to larger problems. Also, some philosophical arguments arose
    against them, maintaining that symbolic systems are an incompatible model for
    organic intelligence. As a result, old and new technologies have been developed
    that were inspired by biology. The old Neural Networks were dusted off from the
    shelf, with the success of Nettalk in 1986, a program that was able to learn how
    to read aloud, and with the publication of the book "*Parallel distributed processing*"

    Navigation*). Going up the chain, we can see that the agent perceives the world
    ([Chapter 4](1773b819-a79b-4339-ab07-6833fd9bc3a0.xhtml),* Environment Query System,
    and 5, Agent Awareness*), and, based on this perception, the agent can make a
    decision ([Chapter 2](00781951-41e3-4e33-8512-052e7aecfd15.xhtml), *Behavior Trees
    and Blackboards*). Sometimes, making the best decision at that moment in time,
    might not lead to a better result in the long run, and so the agent should be
    able to plan ahead. Often, in video games, an AI system (which is not necessarily
    an NPC) can control more than one character, and, as a result, it should be able
    to coordinate a group of characters. Finally, the agent might need to collaborate
    with other agents. Of course, we won't be able to go deep into each topic in this
    book, but feel free to take a look online so that you can dive deeper into certain
