<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch07lvl1sec80" class="calibre1"/>Introduction</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Coreference<a id="id623" class="calibre1"/> is a basic mechanism in human language that allows two sentences to be about the same thing. It's a big deal for human communication—it functions much in the same way as variable names do in programming languages, with the additional subtly that scope is defined by very different rules than blocks. Coreference is less important commercially—maybe this chapter will help change that. Here is an example:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">Alice walked into the garden. She was surprised.</pre></div><p class="calibre9">Coreference exists between <code class="email">Alice</code> and <code class="email">She</code>; the phrases talk about the same thing. It all gets very interesting when we start asking whether Alice in one document is the same as Alice in another.</p><p class="calibre9">Coreference, like word-sense disambiguation, is a next-generation industrial capacity. The challenges of coreference contribute to the insistence of the IRS to have a social security number that unambiguously identifies persons independent of their names. Many of the techniques discussed were developed to help track persons and organizations in text data with varying degrees of success.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch07lvl1sec81" class="calibre1"/>Named entity coreference with a document</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">As seen in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Finding Spans in Text – Chunking" href="part0061_split_000.html#page">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre10">Finding Spans in Text – Chunking</em>, LingPipe can use a variety of techniques to recognize<a id="id624" class="calibre1"/> proper nouns that correspond to persons, places, things, genes, and so on. However, chunking doesn't quite finish the job, because it doesn't help with finding an entity when two named entities are the same. Being able to say that John Smith is the same entity as Mr. Smith, John or even an exact repeat, John Smith, can be very useful—so useful that the idea was the basis of our company when we were a baby-defense contractor. Our novel contribution was the generation of sentences indexed by what entities they mentioned, which turned out to be an excellent way to summarize what was being said about that entity, particularly if the mapping spanned languages—we call it <a id="id625" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre2">entity-based summarization</strong>.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note14" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre9">The idea for entity-based summarization came about as a result of a talk Baldwin gave at the University of Pennsylvania at a graduate student seminar. Mitch Marcus, the then department chair, thought that showing all sentences that mentioned an entity—including pronouns—will be an excellent summary of that entity. In some sense, this comment is why LingPipe exists. It led to Baldwin leading a UPenn DARPA project and then the creation of Alias-i. Lesson learned—talk to everybody about your ideas and research.</p></div><p class="calibre9">This recipe will take you through the basics of computing coreferences.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch07lvl2sec186" class="calibre1"/>How it works…</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The coreference code in <a id="id626" class="calibre1"/>LingPipe is a heuristic system built on top of sentence detection and named-entity recognition. The overall flow is as follows:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Tokenize the text.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Detect sentences in the document, for each sentence, detect named entities in the sentence in the left-to-right order, and for each named entity, perform the following tasks:<div><ol class="orderedlist1"><li class="listitem" value="1">Create a mention.

If a unique match is found, then add the mention to the mention chain; otherwise, create a new mention chain.</li></ol><div></div></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre9">The code is in <code class="email">src/com/lingpipe/cookbook/chapter7/NamedEntityCoreference.java</code>. The <code class="email">main()</code> method starts by setting up the parts of this recipe, starting with a tokenizer factory, sentence chunker, and finally, a named-entity chunker:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public static void main(String[] args) 
    throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException {
  String inputDoc = args.length &gt; 0 ? args[0] 
        : "data/simpleCoref.txt";

      + inputDoc);
  TokenizerFactory mTokenizerFactory

   File modelFile  
    = new File("models/ne-en-news-"
      + "muc6.AbstractCharLmRescoringChunker");
  Chunker namedEntChunker
    = (Chunker) AbstractExternalizable.readObject(modelFile);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">Now, we have set up the basic infrastructure for the recipe. Next is a coreference-specific class:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">MentionFactory mf = new EnglishMentionFactory();</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The <code class="email">MentionFactory</code> class <a id="id627" class="calibre1"/>creates mentions from phrases and types—the current source is named <code class="email">entities</code>. Next, the coreference class is created with <code class="email">MentionFactory</code> as a parameter:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">WithinDocCoref coref = new WithinDocCoref(mf);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The <code class="email">WithinDocCoref</code> class wraps all the mechanics of computing coreference.

String text = Files.readFromFile(doc,Strings.UTF8);
Chunking sentenceChunking
  = sentenceChunker.chunk(text);
Iterator sentenceIt 
  = sentenceChunking.chunkSet().iterator();

for (int sentenceNum = 0; sentenceIt.hasNext(); ++sentenceNum) {

  System.out.println("Sentence Text=" + sentenceText);

  Chunking neChunking = namedEntChunker.chunk(sentenceText);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">In the context of the current sentence, the named entities from the sentence are iterated over in the left-to-right order as they would be read. We know this because the <code class="email">ChunkingImpl</code> class returns chunks in the order that they were added, and our <code class="email">HMMChunker</code> adds them in the left-to-right order:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">Chunking neChunking = namedEntChunker.chunk(sentenceText);
for (Chunk neChunk : neChunking.chunkSet()) {</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The following <a id="id628" class="calibre1"/>code takes the information from the chunk—type and phrase, but <em class="calibre10">not</em> the offset information, and creates a mention:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">String mentionText
  = sentenceText.substring(neChunk.start(),
          neChunk.end());
String mentionType = neChunk.type();
Mention mention = mf.create(mentionText,mentionType);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The next line runs coreference with the mention and what sentence it is in and returns its ID:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">int mentionId = coref.resolveMention(mention,sentenceNum);

System.out.println("     mention text=" + mentionText
            + " type=" + mentionType
            + " id=" + mentionId);</pre></div><p class="calibre9">If the mention was resolved to an existing entity, it will have that ID, as we saw with Mr. Smith. Otherwise, it will get a distinct ID and itself be available as an antecedent for subsequent mentions.</p><p class="calibre9">This covers the mechanics of running within a document coreference. The upcoming recipes will cover the modification of this class. The next recipe will add pronouns and provide references.</p></div></div>

This recipe is more complicated. The code that backs this recipe is not going to fit into the allocated space for complete explanation. The exposition assumes that you will explore entire classes on your own and that you will refer to other recipes in this book for explanation. We offer this recipe because XDoc coreference is a very interesting problem, and our existing infrastructure might help others explore the phenomenon. Welcome to the deep end of the pool.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch07lvl3sec21" class="calibre1"/>The batch process life cycle</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The entire process is <a id="id645" class="calibre1"/>controlled by the <code class="email">RunTracker.java</code> class. The overall flow of the <code class="email">main()</code> method is as follows:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Read the DB of known entities that will be a source of named-entity recognition via <code class="email">Dictionary</code> and a known mapping from aliases to dictionary entries. Aliases come with instructions regarding whether they should be used for matching entities across documents via the <code class="email">xdc=1</code> or <code class="email">xdc=0</code> flag.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Set up <code class="email">EnitityUniverse</code>, which is the global data structure of IDs for what is found in the texts and from the mentioned dictionary of known entities.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Set up what is needed for within-document coreference—things such as a tokenizer, sentence detector, and named-entity detector. It gets a bit fancy with a POS tagger and some word counts.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">There is a Boolean that controls whether speculative entities will be added. If this Boolean is <code class="email">true</code>, it means that we will update our universe of cross-document entities with the ones that we have never seen before. It is a much tougher task to reliably compute with this set to <code class="email">true</code>.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">All the mentioned configuration goes into creating a <code class="email">Tracker</code> object.</li><li class="listitem" value="6">Then, the <code class="email">main()</code> method reads in documents to process, hands them off to the <code class="email">Tracker</code> object for processing, and writes them to disk. The major steps of the <code class="email">Tracker.processDocuments()</code> method are as follows:<div><ol class="orderedlist1"><li class="listitem" value="1">Take a set of documents in the XML format and get the individual documents.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">For each document, apply the <code class="email">processDocument()</code> method, which runs within-document coreference using the dictionary to help find entities as well as the named-entity detector and returns <code class="email">MentionChain[]</code>. Then, resolve the individual mentions' chains against the entity universe to update document-level IDs to entity universe IDs. The last step is to write the document to disk with the entity universe IDs.</li></ol><div></div></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre9">That is all that we will say about <code class="email">RunTracker</code>; there is nothing in there that you should not be able to handle in the context of this book. In the following sections, we will address the individual components that <code class="email">RunTracker</code> uses.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title3"><a id="ch07lvl4sec06" class="calibre1"/>Setting up the entity universe</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The entity <a id="id646" class="calibre1"/>universe <code class="email">EntityUniverse.java</code>, is an in-memory representation of the global entities mentioned in a document/database collection. The entity universe also contains various indexes into these entities, which support computing XDoc on individual documents.</p><p class="calibre9">The dictionary seeds the <code class="email">EntityUniverse</code> file with known entities, and the documents processed subsequently are sensitive to these entities. The XDoc algorithm tries to merge with existing entities before creating new ones, so the dictionary entities are strong attractors for mentions of these entities.</p><p class="calibre9">Each entity consists of a unique long ID, a set of aliases partitioned into four separate lists and a type (person, location, and so on). Whether the entity is in the user-defined dictionary and whether speculative mentions are allowed to be added to the entity are also mentioned. The <code class="email">toString()</code> method lists an entity as:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">id=556 type=ORGANIZATION userDefined=true allowSpec=false user XDC=[Nokia Corp., Nokia] user non-XDC=[] spec XDC=[] spec non-XDC
=[]</pre></div><p class="calibre9">The global data structures are as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    private long mLastId = FIRST_SYSTEM_ID;</pre></div><p class="calibre9">Entities need <a id="id647" class="calibre1"/>unique IDs, and we have a convention that the <code class="email">FIRST_SYSTEM_ID</code> value is a large integer, such as <code class="email">1,000,000</code>. This provides a space (IDs &lt; 1,000,000) for users to add new entities without collisions with entities found by the system.</p><p class="calibre9">We will instantiate a tokenizer for use across the tracker:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    private final TokenizerFactory mTokenizerFactory;</pre></div><p class="calibre9">There is a global mapping from unique entity IDs to the entities:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    private final Map&lt;Long,Entity&gt; mIdToEntity
        = new HashMap&lt;Long,Entity&gt;();</pre></div><p class="calibre9">Another important data structure is a mapping from aliases (phrases) to entities that have the alias—<code class="email">mXdcPhraseToEntitySet</code>. Only phrases that are candidates for finding likely matches for cross-document coreference get added here. From the dictionary, the aliases that are <code class="email">xdc=1</code> are added:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">private final ObjectToSet&lt;String,Entity&gt; mXdcPhraseToEntitySet
        = new ObjectToSet&lt;String,Entity&gt;();</pre></div><p class="calibre9">For speculatively found aliases, if the alias has at least two tokens and is not already on another entity, it is added to this set. This reflects a heuristic that tries hard to not split the entities apart. The logic of this is quite twisted and beyond the scope of this tutorial. You can refer to <code class="email">EntityUniverse.createEntitySpeculative</code> and <code class="email">EntityUniverse.addPhraseToEntity</code> for the code.</p><p class="calibre9">Why are some aliases not used in finding candidate entities? Consider that <code class="email">George</code> has very little descriptive content to discriminate entities in <code class="email">EntityUniverse</code>, but <code class="email">George H.W.

Good phrases might be <code class="email">Breckenridge Baldwin</code>, because that is likely a unique name.

The reasoning is as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre2">There is already an entity associated with the phrase</strong>: This enforces an assumption that there is only one John Smith in the world.

Looking down at the scores, we can see that the complete link reports the best F-measure with 11 clusters at <code class="email">0.60</code>—in truth, there are 35 clusters. The single-link approach maxes out F-measure at 68 clusters with <code class="email">0.78</code> and shows much greater robustness on varying numbers of clusters. The cross case shows that single<a id="id674" class="calibre1"/> link and complete link are quite different in direct comparison as well.

Bush, both large clusters, than to mistake George Bush, the mechanic who got mentioned once in the dataset. Other scoring metrics will count both the mistakes as equally bad. It is the standard scoring metric used in the literature for this phenomenon.</li></ol><div></div></div></div>
