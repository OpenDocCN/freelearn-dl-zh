			<ul>
				<li>What is a prompt?</li>
				<li>Single-line prompts for auto-code generation</li>
				<li>Multi-line prompts for auto-code generation</li>
				<li>Chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation</li>

				<li>Common building methods of auto-code generation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With the growth<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> in <strong class="bold">large language model</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLM</strong>) applications, one of the interesting use cases, auto-code generation based on user comments, has become popular. The last few years have given rise to multiple code assistants for developers, such as GitHub Copilot, Codex, Pythia, and Amazon Q Developer, among many others. These code assistants can be used to get code recommendations and, in many cases, generate error-free code from scratch, just by passing a few plain text comments that describe what the user requires from the code.</p>
			<p>Many of these code assistants are now backed by LLMs. LLMs are pretrained on large publicly available datasets, including public code bases. This training on large corpora of data helps code assistants generate more accurate, relevant code recommendations. To improve the developer’s code-writing experience, these code assistants can not only easily integrate with different <strong class="bold">integrated development environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) and code editors but are also readily available with different services offered by most of the cloud providers, with minimal configuration.</p>
			<p>Overall, auto-code generation is a process in which the developer has the ability to interact with different code assistants from any supported code editor, using simple plain text comments, to get code recommendations in real time for different supported coding languages.</p>
			<p>Before we go deeper into auto-code generation with the help of code assistants later in this chapter, let’s look at the key concept of prompts related to generative AI.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>What is a prompt?</h1>
			<p>As specified earlier, LLMs are<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> pretrained on publicly available large datasets, which makes them very powerful and versatile. These LLMs typically have billions of parameters that can be used to solve multiple tasks out of the box, without the need for additional training.</p>
			<p>Users just need to ask the right question with relevant context to get the best output from an LLM. The plain text comments/questions that act as an instruction to an LLM are called <strong class="bold">prompts</strong> and the technique of asking the right questions with corresponding context is <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>called <strong class="bold">prompt engineering</strong>. While interacting with LLMs, providing prompts with precise information and, if required, supplementing with additional relevant context, is very important in order to get the most accurate results. The same is true while interacting with code assistants as most of the code assistants are integrated with an LLM. As a user, while interacting with a code assistant, you should provide prompts with simple, specific, and relevant context, which helps to generate quality code with high accuracy.</p>
			<p>The following diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>shows the integration of a code assistant with an LLM.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.1 – Overview of code assistant integration with an LLM" src="img/B21378_03_01.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Overview of code assistant integration with an LLM</p>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>multiple ways to interact with code assistants to get the desired outcomes. In the following sections, we will explore a few of those techniques. To illustrate these techniques, we will leverage the Python programming language inside JetBrains’ PyCharm IDE that has been set up to work with Amazon Q Developer (refer <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a> for the setup).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Amazon Q Developer uses LLMs in the background to generate the code. LLMs, by nature, are non-deterministic, so you may not get exactly the same code blocks as shown in the code snapshots. However, logically, the generated code should meet the requirements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Single-line prompts for auto-code generation</h1>
			<p>A single-line prompt for<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> auto-code generation<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> refers to the technique in which the user, using a code assistant, specifies requirements in a single line of plain text, with the expectation of getting relevant lines of code generated in an automated manner.</p>
			<p>Here are some key points about single-line prompts for auto-code generation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the single-line prompt technique, instead of specifying complex technical details, the user needs to effectively summarize the requirements at a high level in plain text.</li>
				<li>Code assistants integrated with LLMs are trained to understand these single-line prompts in order to translate them into executable and mostly error-free code.</li>
				<li>Based on<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> the single-line prompt with instructions, context, and specific requirements, code assistants will generate <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>code that can range from a single line to multiple lines to more complex functions and classes to meet the intended functional requirements.</li>
				<li>A single-line prompt for auto-code generation is useful when the code requirement is relatively simple and can easily be described in a sentence.</li>
				<li>A single-line prompt for auto-code generation can significantly reduce time, compared to manually writing the same code.</li>
				<li>Since a single-line prompt for auto-code generation does not need much prompt-engineering experience, it is most commonly used by users who have little to no coding experience. In plain text, they can provide <em class="italic">what</em> the code should do instead of <em class="italic">how</em> to make it happen using actual code.</li>
				<li>In most cases, as simple requirements are used in a single-line prompt, the generated code may not require extensive reviews.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary – single-line prompts for auto-code generation</p>
			<p class="callout">In summary, a single-line prompt for auto-code generation is a technique where the user describes relatively simple code requirements using natural language in plain text format; the code assistant then uses LLMs to auto-generate single or multiple lines of code. It makes coding much simpler and accessible to more people, especially users who have relatively little or no coding experience or may be new to a specific coding language.</p>
			<p>The following is an example of a single-line prompt for auto-code generation in a PyCharm IDE with<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> Amazon Q Developer enabled as the <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>code assistant, followed by the response:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
# generate code to display hello world in python</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.2 – Auto-code generation with a single-line prompt in PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_002.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Auto-code generation with a single-line prompt in PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that Amazon Q Developer generated a single line of code as our requirement was simple and could be easily achieved within a single-line prompt. We will look at more complex examples in our next chapters. In this chapter, we are just explaining the different techniques of auto-code generation.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You may find typos in a few prompts and screenshots in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of the book. We have purposely not corrected them to highlight that Amazon Q Developer understands the underlying meaning of what's being asked, even with incorrect grammar in the prompts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Multi-line prompts for auto-code generation</h1>
			<p>Multi-line prompts for<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> auto-code generation<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> refer to the technique where a user can define requirements using natural language text in a single prompt, which can span multiple sentences. Based on the information provided in each of the sentences, the code assistant then tries to understand the correlation among them in order to grasp the requirements and generate the desired code.</p>
			<p>The code assistant will mainly rely on key phrases from each of the sentences; it will then use each of those key phrases to form a relationship among all the sentences. This guides code assistants to use LLMs to form a sequence of code lines to meet the requirement. In most cases, code assistants will generate multiple lines of code.</p>
			<p>Here are some key points about multi-line prompts for auto-code generation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Multi-line prompts for auto-code generation are useful when the code requirement is relatively complex, has multiple steps, and cannot be easily described in one simple sentence, as it may require more context.</li>
				<li>Code assistants use each sentence from the multi-line prompt to extract key phrases, then use an LLM to understand the relationship across sentences and key phrases. This generates the interpretation of the code fragments and corresponding correlations to define end-to-end code requirements.</li>
				<li>Due to the complexity of the requirements, better quality and more targeted code is usually achieved by providing context in multiple simple, concise sentences. These sentences can provide details such as functionality requirements, architectural constraints, and platform specifications.</li>
				<li>Code generated by multi-line prompts is more customized, elaborative, and relatively complex versus single-line prompts.</li>
				<li>Generated code may require code review and thorough testing, and, depending on the complexity of the requirements, some code refinement may be needed before being promoted to the next project life cycle.</li>
				<li>Multi-line prompts for auto-code generation require a good grasp of prompt engineering. It’s important to include key details without being overly verbose or ambiguous and to understand the generated code. As a result, this technique is typically used by users with coding experience.</li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>accuracy of the code is highly<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> dependent on the maturity/training of the code assistants and LLM used to generate the code.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary – multi-line prompts for auto-code generation</p>
			<p class="callout">In summary, multi-line prompts for auto-code generation is a technique where users describe relatively complex code goals in plain natural language text with multiple sentences. Then, the code assistant can use the key phrases from those sentences to form relationships around them, which helps understand the user requirements and turn them into multiple lines of code. It requires some degree of experience in prompt engineering, code reviews, and in some cases, rewriting the generated code.</p>
			<p>The following is an example of a multi-line prompt for auto-code generation.</p>
			<p>We will use an auto-generated code block for the following requirements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The code needs to be generated with a specific language version – in this case, Python 3.6.0.</li>
				<li>The code needs to read the <code>/</code><code>user/data/input/sample.csv</code> file.</li>
				<li>The code needs to load data in a pandas DataFrame with a specific name, <code>csv_data.</code></li>
				<li>The code needs to display a sample of 50 rows with a column header.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We write the prompt as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
"""
Generate code in python 3.6.0 version.
Read CSV file from /user/data/input/sample.csv in a pandas dataframe named csv_data.
Use csv_data dataframe to display sample 50 records with corresponding column details.
"""</pre>			<p>We get <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>following output:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.3 – Auto-code generation with a multi﻿-line prompt in the PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_003.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Auto-code generation with a multi-line prompt in the PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that Amazon Q Developer generated multiple lines of code with two functions – <code>read_csv_file()</code> to read the CSV file and <code>display_sample_records()</code> to display 50 records. Then, it created <code>__main__</code> to call both functions to generate an end-to-end script.</p>
			<p>Overall, the preceding code does meet the requirements but, based on user/corporate preferences, may need some modification and/or tuning. In the next section, we will learn about another technique suitable for experienced developers. This technique is particularly beneficial when developers are familiar with the code flow and require assistance in generating the code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation</h1>
			<p>Chain-of-thought prompts <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>for auto-code generation <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>refer to a technique where the user employs a combination of single-line or multi-line prompts to provide step-by-step instructions. Code assistants then use an LLM to automatically generate code for each step individually. Users can use multiple natural language prompts that can link together to solve complex requirements. These prompts can be chained together to guide the model to produce relevant targeted code. It’s an effective technique to divide complex coding tasks into smaller code fragments by providing simple prompts to the code assistant one at a time. The code assistant can use each prompt to generate more tailored code fragments. Ultimately, all the code fragments can be used as building blocks to solve the complex requirement.</p>
			<p>Here are some key points about chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chain-of-thought prompts are a technique in which users divide complex requirements into smaller, more manageable single-line or multi-line prompts.</li>
				<li>Chain-of-thought prompts can also be useful for code customization. Users can effectively use this technique to obtain customized code by providing specific information in a prompt, such as generating code with relevant variable names, specific function names, step-by-step logic flow, and so on.</li>
				<li>Code assistants leverage advances in LLMs to generate the code fragments to meet each individual prompt, which acts as a part of the final end-to-end code.</li>
				<li>Chain-of-thought prompts can be used to generate code for a wide range of tasks, such as creating a new project, implementing a specific feature, customizing the code to meet custom standards, improving flexibility, accuracy of the code, and code organization.</li>
				<li>Generated code may require code review and integration testing to verify whether all the individual code fragments combined meet the end-to-end requirements. Depending on the outcome of test cases, users may need to readjust the prompts or rewrite some of the code blocks before being promoted to the next project life cycle.</li>
				<li>This <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>technique can be used by more experienced users as they are mainly responsible for tracking the code generation flow to meet the final goal.</li>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> accuracy of the overall code is highly dependent on the prompts provided by users, due to which users need to have some background in prompt engineering to generate accurate end-to-end code.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary – chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation</p>
			<p class="callout">In summary, chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation are a technique in which users describe complex code requirements in smaller, easier, and more manageable single-line or multi-line prompts of plain, natural language text. The code assistant uses each of these prompts to generate specific code based on the information provided in a prompt. In the end, the output from all these individual prompts combined generates the final code. This technique is effective in creating highly tailored code. User needs to carry out integration tests to verify that the code meets the end-to-end functionality; based on the test case results, users may need to adjust the prompts and/or rewrite some of the code fragments of the final code.</p>
			<p>The following is an example of chain-of-thought prompts for auto-code generation.</p>
			<p>We will use an auto-generated code block with multiple prompts for the following requirements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use the Python coding language.</li>
				<li>The code must check whether the <code>/user/data/input/sample.csv</code> file is present.</li>
				<li>Create a function named <code>read_csv_file()</code> to read the CSV files. Also, try to use a specific <code>read_csv</code> from pandas to read records.</li>
				<li>Use the <code>read_csv_file()</code> function to read the <code>/</code><code>user/data/input/sample.csv</code> file.</li>
				<li>Display a sample of 50 records with corresponding column details from the file.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>break down <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>the preceding requirements into three separate prompts.</p>
			<p>Note that, for simplicity, in this example, we will use single-line prompts for auto-code generation but based on the complexity of your requirements, you can have a combination of single-line and multi-line prompts to achieve chain-of-thought prompts. The code assistant generates multiple lines of code based on the prompts, accompanied by corresponding inline comments. This simplifies the understanding of the code for users.</p>
			<p>Here is the first prompt followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt 1 :
# Generate code to Check if /user/data/input/sample.csv exists</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.4 – Prompt 1: auto-code generation with a chain-of-thought prompt in the PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_004.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Prompt 1: auto-code generation with a chain-of-thought prompt in the PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>that Amazon Q Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> created multiple lines of code that included a function called <code>check_file_exists()</code> with one parameter to get <code>file_path</code>, which checks whether the file exists or not and returns <code>True</code>/<code>False</code>. It also added the next <code>file_path</code> variable with an assigned value as the <code>/</code><code>user/data/input/sample.csv</code> path.</p>
			<p>Here is the second prompt followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>Here, also<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> observe that Amazon Q Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>created multiple lines of code. As instructed, it created a function called <code>read_csv_file_file_exists()</code> with one parameter to get <code>file_path</code> and used the <code>read_csv</code> method to read the file.</p>

			<p>Let’s move on to the next technique for auto-code generation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Chat with code assistant for auto-code generation</h1>
			<p>Many of<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> the code assistants allow users to use a <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>chat-style interaction technique to get code recommendations and auto-generate error-free code. Some of the code assistant examples include but are not limited to Amazon Q Developer, ChatGPT, and Copilot. Just like asking questions to your teammates to get recommendations, users can interact with code assistants to ask questions and get recommendations/suggestions related to your questions. In addition, many of the code assistants will also provide the details in a step-by-step walk-through for the information associated with <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>the answer, and will also provide some reference links to get more context. Users can review the details and can choose to integrate the code into the main program and/or update existing code.</p>
			<p>Here are some<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> key points about chatting with a code assistant for auto-code generation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chatting with a code assistant helps users to engage in a question-and-answer style interaction in real time.</li>
				<li>Chatting with a code assistant allows users to receive suggestions and recommendations by directly asking questions and stating their requirements in natural language.</li>
				<li>This technique can be used by users of any experience level to obtain information and suggestions, but it requires some experience to understand and review the recommended code. It can be utilized to obtain responses for a variety of complex code issues, learn new technology, generate detailed designs, retrieve overall architecture details, discover coding best practices and code documentation, perform debugging tasks, and future support for the generated code.</li>
				<li>During coding, similar to other prompting techniques, it allows users to describe complex requirements in smaller, more manageable step-by-step questions to generate code. Additionally, the code assistant tracks the questions and corresponding answers to improve responses for future questions by recommending the most relevant options.</li>
				<li>In most cases, users are responsible for reviewing and testing to verify that the recommended code truly meets the overall needs and integrates within the overall code base.</li>
				<li>To help users understand the code, the code assistant also provides a detailed flow associated with the answer and reference links to obtain additional context.</li>
				<li>Many of the<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> advanced code assistants, such as Amazon Q Developer, also gather context from current files open in the IDE. They automatically retrieve information related to the coding language used and the location of the file to provide more relevant answers. This assists the code assistant in handling questions related to updating existing code, software support, software development, best practices, and so on.</li>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> accuracy of the overall code is highly dependent on the user’s ability to ask relevant and accurate questions with specific details.</li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Summary – chatting with a code assistant for auto-code generation</p>
			<p class="callout">In summary, users at any level of experience can utilize chatting with the code assistant for auto-code generation.

			<p>Now, let’s get into the topic of different building methods of auto-code generation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Common building methods of auto-code generation</h1>
			<p>As described in<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> the previous sections, different levels of experienced users can make use of code assistants to generate the desired code to meet functional requirements. In this section, we will walk through some common<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> building methods useful for auto-code generation, depending on the complexity of the requirements. We will use Amazon Q Developer integration with JetBrains’ PyCharm IDE to illustrate how a code assistant can help users automate the generation of code fragments and/or get recommendations from the system.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s begin with each of the code-building methods used in the auto-code generation technique.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Single-line code completion</h2>
			<p>Code assistants<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> that leverage LLMs can keep track of all the prompts provided as input by a user. At runtime, code assistants use all the input information to suggest relevant code. Here is a simple demonstration of how Amazon Q Developer helps users with single-line code completion.</p>
			<p>When users start typing code in an Amazon Q Developer-enabled environment, it can understand the context of the current and previous inputs. It will start suggesting the next code block to complete the existing line or recommend the next line that may follow after the current one. The following screenshot highlights this method:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.11 – Single-line code completion in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_011.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.11 – Single-line code completion in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>when the user starts typing the DataFrame name, <code>csv_data</code>, Amazon Q Developer suggests using the <code>read_csv_file()</code> function, which is defined in the script.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Full function generation</h2>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>basic building blocks of programming is functions. Typically, a function is a reusable multi-line block of code, defined anywhere in the program, to perform a specific task. Functions do not run unless called. A function can accept parameters or arguments that can be passed when being called in your script. Optionally, a function can return data to the calling statement. Code assistants can help users write an entire function body. Users just need to provide the information about the functionality they need from a function, and optionally, the programming language, using any of the previous auto-code generation techniques.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s look at an example of how users can auto-generate a function.</p>
			<p>The following is a simple demonstration of how Amazon Q Developer helps users with the generation of a full function:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The user needs to write a simple Python function named <code>read_csv()</code> that takes <code>file_path</code> as a parameter and returns a sample of 50 records</li>
				<li>Call the <code>read_csv()</code> function to read a CSV file from the <code>/</code><code>user/data/input/sample.csv</code> path</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will use the chain-of-thought prompt technique to generate the preceding code. Here is the first prompt followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt 1 :

			<p>Observe, as <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>instructed in the single-line prompt, that Amazon Q Developer has created a Python function named <code>read_csv()</code> that takes <code>file_path</code> as a parameter and returns a sample of 50 records.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s look at how you can get the function statement logic auto-generated, followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.13 – Full function generation in PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer – calling the function</p>
			<p>Observe, as instructed<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> in Amazon Q Developer, that the call logic is generated for the <code>read_csv()</code> function to read data from the <code>/</code><code>user/data/input/sample.csv </code>file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Block completion</h2>
			<p>During <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>the logical flow of a program, users need to run certain code blocks based on conditions and/or need to run certain lines in loops. The most common code blocks to achieve these functionalities are <code>if</code> conditions, <code>for</code> loops, <code>while</code> conditions, and <code>try</code> blocks. Code assistants are trained to complete and suggest possible code to write these conditional and loop statements.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s see how Amazon Q Developer can help users suggest possible <code>if</code> conditions in the previously created function in the <em class="italic">Full function generation</em> example (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.13</em>). As Amazon Q Developer understands the context of the code, it’s able to understand the functionality associated with the <code>read_csv()</code> function. So, start typing <code>if</code> inside the <code>read_csv()</code> function to show our intent to write a conditional block:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.14 – Block completion in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_014.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.14 – Block completion in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that, once<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> the user starts typing <code>if</code>, Amazon Q Developer understands that <code>file_path</code> is a mandatory parameter for the <code>read_csv()</code> function and expects to have a <code>.csv</code> file; based on this understanding, it suggests adding an error handling condition to check whether the passed parameter has a <code>.</code><code>csv</code> file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Line-by-line recommendations</h2>
			<p>Generally, user requirements <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>can be complex and users may not be able to define all of them using a combination of multiple prompts. In a few cases, code assistants may not be able to generate the script as expected by the user in a single code generation. In addition, if the user decides to update the existing code, then Amazon Q Developer provides line-by-line recommendations. Amazon Q Developer tries to understand the context of the script and predict relevant next lines that might be logically useful.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s use the previous script from the <em class="italic">Block completion</em> section (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.14</em>) to check whether Amazon Q Developer can recommend the next line of code. To illustrate the functionality, let’s delete the last line, <code>print(data)</code>. Then, go to the last line of the <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>script and press <em class="italic">Enter</em>; now, Amazon Q Developer will try to predict the next logical functionality for the script:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.15 – Line-by-line recommendations in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_015.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.15 – Line-by-line recommendations in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that, in this script, Amazon Q Developer is suggesting the print DataFrame statement, <code>print(data)</code>, which makes logical sense as we read the data from the <code>sample.csv</code> file in a DataFrame named <code>data</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Cross-reference existing code</h2>
			<p>One of the common<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> best coding practices is to use existing functions from different files in the same repository of code. Many developers like to create reusable functions and save them in a common file that can be referenced in other scripts. Code assistants understand existing scripts and functions present across the repository. This allows them to help users recommend new code referencing functions from existing files. Users can write simple single-line prompts to suggest Code assistants to generate the code referencing existing functions from a particular program file.</p>
			<p>For example, Amazon Q Developer has functionalities available that can cross-reference the existing code during new code generation. Let’s assume the user already has the function saved in the <code>prompt-Fullfunctiongeneration.py</code> file (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.14</em>) and wants to use the existing function, <code>read_csv</code>, in a new script. Here is the prompt followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
# read test.csv file using read_csv function from prompt-Fullfunctiongeneration.py file</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.16 – Cross-referencing the existing code in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_016.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.16 – Cross-referencing the existing code in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that Amazon Q Developer imported all the functions from <code>prompt_fullfunctiongeneration</code> and then used the <code>read_csv()</code> function and generated code to read the <code>test.csv</code> file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Generating sample data</h2>
			<p>During the <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>development process, developers commonly need sample data that may or may not be readily available. Code assistants can help users generate sample data in different ways. We will explore a couple of methods by which Amazon Q Developer can help users generate the sample data.</p>
			<p>Let’s assume that a user already has some sample data and wants to create additional records to bump up the volume of data. Just like many other code assistants, Amazon Q Developer understands the structure and format of the existing sample data to generate the next sample record. In the following sample example, the user has one record in JSON format with <code>sr_nbr</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>city</code> as attributes. Once the user hits <em class="italic">Enter</em> at the end of the first record, Amazon Q Developer will start generating sample records. The following screenshot highlights this feature:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.17 – Generating sample data in PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_017.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.17 – Generating sample data in PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that Amazon Q Developer is suggesting the next sample record based on the structure from an existing record, <code>{"sr_nbr": 2, "name": "Jane", "age": 25, "</code><code>city": "Chicago"}</code>.</p>
			<p>Let’s consider <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>another example and assume that the user does not have a sample dataset but is aware of the attributes needed in the sample data. The user needs to create a fixed number of sample records. In this case, the user can use prompts to generate the sample data. In the following sample example, the user has entered a prompt to generate 50 records in JSON format with <code>sr_nbr</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>city</code> as the desired attributes. With this prompt, Amazon Q Developer suggested a random data generation function.</p>
			<p>Here is the prompt followed by the output:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
"""
Generate 50 records for user_data json with sr_nbr, name, age, and city
"""</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.18 – Generating sample data in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer – function logic" src="img/B21378_03_018.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.18 – Generating sample data in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer – function logic</p>
			<p>Observe that based on the requirement specified in the prompt, Amazon Q Developer generated the <code>generate_user_data()</code> function with a range of <code>50</code> to generate sample data with the <code>sr_nbr</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>city</code> attributes in a JSON file format.</p>
			<p>In addition, if you<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> press <em class="italic">Enter</em> at the end of the function, you will observe that Amazon Q Developer will use a line-by-line recommendation to suggest end-to-end code and also save data in a <code>user_data.json</code> file. The following screenshot highlights this feature:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Writing unit tests</h2>
			<p>Testing the <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>scripts is an imperative part of coding. Testing code needs to be done at different phases, such as unit testing during or toward the end of coding, integration testing across multiple scripts, and so on. Let’s explore the options available with code assistants to support unit test creation. As discussed earlier, code assistants can understand the context of scripts. This helps developers reference existing program files during unit test creation.</p>
			<p>Let’s assume a user wants to create unit tests for the previously generated code to generate sample data (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.18</em>). The user can use a simple single-line prompt to create the unit tests. Amazon Q Developer can analyze the code present in the function file and generate the basic unit test cases. The following prompt and output showcases this capability:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Prompt:
"""
Create unit tests for the generate_user_data() function from sample_data_generation.py file
"""</pre>			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.20 – Writing unit tests in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer" src="img/B21378_03_020.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.20 – Writing unit tests in the PyCharm IDE using Amazon Q Developer</p>
			<p>Observe that <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>Amazon Q Developer used the input prompt to reference the <code>generate_user_data()</code> function from the <code>sample_data_generation.py</code> file and, based on the functionality, generated a basic unit test case. In addition, it also created a full end-to-end script that can be used to run the unit test case.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Explaining and documenting code</h2>
			<p>During the <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>life cycle of the project, many developers work on the same script to add code or update existing code. A lack of documentation can make it really difficult for everyone to understand the end-to-end logic in the script. To help developers understand existing code, many of the code assistants have different mechanisms to generate explanations of the code in natural language, and plain text format. Users can use the outcome of these options to create documentation or embed details in the comments section of the script.</p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer can help users generate the documentation with respect to the existing script. Once the script is open in an IDE, just type the <code>Explain</code> command in Q’s chat session. Amazon Q Developer will analyze the whole script and will return the natural language text, explaining the functionality of the script. For example, let’s use the previously created script, <code>prompt-Fullfunctiongeneration.py</code> (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.14</em>), and ask Amazon Q Developer to explain the code.</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.21 – Documenting code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface" src="img/B21378_03_021.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.21 – Documenting code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface</p>
			<p>Observe that the user does not need to specify the script name, as Amazon Q Developer can automatically use the script open in the editor when you type the <code>Explain</code> command. The following screenshot highlights the code explanation provided by Amazon Q Developer:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.22 – Documenting code in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer – documentation" src="img/B21378_03_022.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.22 – Documenting code in the IDE using Amazon Q Developer – documentation</p>
			<p>Observe <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>that Amazon Q Developer generated documentation in natural language. It was able to provide the exact functionality of the <code>read_csv()</code> function; then, it explained that the script used the function to read the <code>/user/data/input/sample.csv</code> file. In this way, any code can easily be documented without having to manually understand the code and type the whole explanation, thus saving time and improving productivity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Updating existing code</h2>
			<p>Similar to the <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>previous examples, developers often inherit previously developed code. Users need to update the code based on newly available libraries and known issues and to improve coding standards.</p>
			<p>Generally, updating existing code falls into one of these three categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Refactoring</strong>: Users need to update existing code to simplify it, making it easy to understand, and/or add additional exceptions to handle errors and so on</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fixing</strong>: Users need to update existing code to fix bugs, which may be known or unknown</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimizing</strong>: Users need to update existing code to improve execution efficiency and performance tune</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To help developers complete the tasks just mentioned, many code assistants offer options. Users can use the outcomes of these options to update existing code and improve coding standards.</p>
			<p>Let’s look at how <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>Amazon Q Developer can help users update existing code. Similar to the <code>Explain</code> command discussed in the previous section, Amazon Q Developer has the <code>Refactor</code>, <code>Fix</code>, and <code>Optimize</code> commands. Once the script is open in an IDE, simply type any of these commands to get recommendations from Amazon Q Developer. Based on the code quality, Amazon Q Developer can provide multiple different recommendations and a direct option to insert the fragment into the existing script.</p>
			<p>As seen in the following screenshot, let’s use the previously created script, <code>prompt-Fullfunctiongeneration.py</code> (reference <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.15</em>), and ask Amazon Q Developer to refactor the code:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.23 – Updating existing code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface: Refactor" src="img/B21378_03_023.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.23 – Updating existing code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface: Refactor</p>
			<p>Observe that Amazon Q Developer can automatically use the script open in the editor when you type the <code>Refactor</code> instruction and suggest multiple recommendations to consider while refactoring. Let’s look at a couple of them in the following section.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, Amazon Q Developer suggests adding hints to the <code>file_path</code> function parameter and returning parameters as a list to improve overall readability:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.24 – Updating existing code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface: Refactor 2" src="img/B21378_03_024.jpg"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.24 – Updating existing code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface: Refactor 2</p>
			<p>As seen in <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>the following screenshot, Amazon Q Developer suggests including additional exception handling for the <code>file_path</code> parameter to check whether the file is of the CSV type and whether the file exists:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.25 – Updating existing code in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface: Refactor 3</p>
			<p>We will explore other options and dive deep into the examples in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Feature development</h2>
			<p>Code assistants<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> can help developers develop features simply by describing them in natural language and specifying key phrases. As a user, you only need to provide keywords/phrases related to the functionality of the feature, and code assistants can generate the end-to-end code.</p>
			<p>Let’s look at how Amazon Q Developer can help users develop features. Amazon Q Developer leverages the context of the current project to generate a comprehensive implementation plan and specifies the necessary code changes. To initiate feature development, the user just needs to open a file within their project and type <code>/dev</code> in the <code>/dev</code>.</p>
			<p>For example, let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to implement a binary search feature. This is highlighted in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.26 – Feature development in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface" src="img/B21378_03_026.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.26 – Feature development in the PyCharm IDE using the Amazon Q Developer interface</p>
			<p>Observe that, based<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> on the command, Amazon Q Developer generated code for the binary search feature, provided details of the code flow/algorithm, and referenced sources to generate the features.</p>
			<p>We will dive deep into detailed examples in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Code transformation</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> upgrading versions, depending on the programming language used, users may have to make various adjustments in their code to ensure compatibility with the latest version. Code assistants offer assistance to developers in upgrading their code, helping them transition from older versions to the most recent ones.</p>
			<p>For example, Amazon Q Developer has the capability to upgrade the code language version. Users can just open the existing old version code and use the <code>/transform</code> command to upgrade the code version directly within their files.</p>
			<p>We will dive deep into further details with examples in <a href="B21378_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered the integration of code assistants with LLMs to assist users with auto-code generation. Then, we explored three commonly used auto-code generation prompting techniques: single-line prompts, multi-line prompts, and chain-of-thought prompts. We introduced each of these prompting techniques for auto-code generation, along with potential use cases, limitations, and required coding experience. Sample code examples were used in JetBrains’ PyCharm IDE with Amazon Q Developer enabled. Additionally, we introduced the <em class="italic">chat with code assistant</em> technique in the auto-code generation process, where users interact with the code assistant in a simple question-and-answer style session. Amazon Q Developer was utilized to obtain general recommendations for coding/debugging.</p>
			<p>We then discussed some of the common building methods of code generation, such as single-line code completion, full function generation, block completion, line-by-line recommendations, generating sample data, writing unit tests, explaining and documenting code, updating existing code, feature development, and code transformation. Furthermore, we explored these functionalities with Amazon Q Developer in JetBrains’ PyCharm IDE to support the most common code-building methods.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll start <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of the book. In this part, <em class="italic">Chapters 4</em> to <em class="italic">9</em> will walk you through how Amazon Q Developer can boost developer productivity by auto-generating code for many supported programming languages. Based on your expertise or preference, feel free to navigate directly to the chapters that interest you the most.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into how to utilize these techniques and building methods within the IDE environment for the Python and Java languages. Additionally, we will create a sample Python application with the assistance of Amazon Q Developer.</p>
