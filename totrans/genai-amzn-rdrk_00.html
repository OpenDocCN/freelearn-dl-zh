<p>This book requires you to have access to an <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) account. If you don’t have it already, you can go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/">https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/</a> and create an AWS account.</p>
<p>Secondly, you will need to install and configure AWS <strong class="bold">Command-Line Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLI</strong>) (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">https://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a>) after you create an account, which will be needed to access Amazon Bedrock foundation models from your local machine.</p>
<p>Thirdly, since the majority of code cells that we will execute are based in Python, setting up an AWS Python SDK (Boto3) (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html</a>) will be required. You can carry out the Python setup in the following ways: install it on your local machine, use AWS Cloud9, utilize AWS Lambda, or leverage Amazon SageMaker.</p>

<p>This part establishes the fundamental principles and practices for effectively leveraging Amazon Bedrock. We begin by exploring the suite of foundation models offered by Amazon Bedrock, providing insights into their capabilities and optimal use cases. The book then progresses to advanced techniques in prompt engineering, a critical skill for maximizing the potential of large language models. We explore strategies for model customization, allowing users to tailor these tools to their specific needs and domains. We also examine the implementation of <strong class="bold">RAG</strong>, a cutting-edge approach that significantly enhances model performance by integrating external knowledge sources.</p>
