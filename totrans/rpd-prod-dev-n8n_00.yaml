    to No Code, n8n, and Bubble*, is where you will gain an understanding of no code
    and why it is becoming important to business and technology. You will also become
    familiar with n8n, a no code automation tool, and Bubble, a no-code development
    platform.'

    UI to Create Workflows*, teaches you how to use n8n''s Editor UI. You will also
    learn about the different kinds of nodes in n8n and how to use them. You will
    then learn about workflows, deal with dynamic data, and finally create your first
    workflow in n8n.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17493_03_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039)*, Diving into
    Core Nodes and Data in n8n,* is where you will learn how to use n8n''s data structure
    to manipulate and transform data inside workflows, and use JavaScript inside your
    low-code workflows to unlock custom functionalities. You''ll call REST APIs from
    inside your workflows using the HTTP Request node. The chapter will also cover
    how to handle real-time events using the Webhook node and how to trigger workflows
    based on this data. You''ll work with arrays and JSON objects inside n8n, understand
    when to use what kind of data format, and transform data inside your workflows.'

    Building Two n8n Apps*, shows you how to combine concepts from the previous chapters
    and use them to build multiple projects. Some of these projects will reinforce
    the concepts you learned earlier and others will introduce some new ideas. This
    will help you understand the kind of products that you can build using n8n. Finally,
    you will learn how to share and discover new workflows as well as participate
    in n8n''s active community.'

    First API Endpoints*, will see you create blueprints for an API endpoint so that
    there''s minimal friction when building the API; you''ll also configure the Webhook
    node so that it can handle requests sent to the API and reply to them. You''ll
    build an API endpoint in n8n based on the blueprints that you created earlier,
    and you''ll secure your API endpoints by using the different authentication methods
    available in the Webhook node. Later, you''ll also test your API to make sure
    that all the functionalities that you implemented work as expected.'

    your project, and reading and writing to Airtable. You will also learn about some
    of the best practices when working with these databases. The concepts covered
    in this chapter will help you to use a data store for your projects to store user-generated
    data and build a complete product.'

    is on your screen may look a bit different than what is in the book. As we were
    nearing the end of the book, n8n updated their user interface, which explains
    why the examples here are different. With that being said, the scripts all continue
    to work exactly the same as described in the book and should work just fine for
    you.
