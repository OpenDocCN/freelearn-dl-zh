     Cost-effectiveness
    
   </h4>
   <p>
    
     Open source tools are inherently devoid of the licensing fees that accompany many proprietary software options.
    
    
     This characteristic is of paramount importance, particularly to entities operating under stringent budget constraints, such as start-ups, independent researchers, or educational institutions.
    
    
     The absence of a financial barrier to entry not only lowers the threshold for initial software deployment but also democratizes access to advanced computational tools such
    
    
     
      as LLMs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Resource allocation without the burden of licensing fees allows for several

      </li>
