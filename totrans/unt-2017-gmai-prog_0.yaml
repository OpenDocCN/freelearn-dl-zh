- en: Welcome to the wonderful world of AI in games, or, more specifically, AI in
    Unity.  This book focuses on the Unity implementations of AI-related features
    and also delves into the basic concepts behind those features. It even provides
    ground-up examples of some of them. Along the way, this book provides example
    projects and sample code for the reader to follow, play with, and, hopefully,
    build upon in their own projects.

- en: While the reader is not expected to be an advanced programmer, this book does
    assume some base-level knowledge of C# and scripting in Unity. That said, the
    sample code provided is well commented and explained throughout the book in a
    very detailed way, in order to describe the reason behind each decision and every
    line of code. Familiarity with some of the algorithms provided is certainly helpful,
    but by no means required. This book will explain the theory and origin of the
    concepts and then delve into implementations that highlight the core functionality
    we're looking for. Extraneous code is kept to a minimum to allow the reader to
    truly focus on the book's main objective—learning AI game programming in Unity.

- en: '[Chapter 1](070df6ee-a9ba-4dca-b175-06a95a96eb7c.xhtml), *The Basics of AI
    in Games*, gets the reader up to speed with the basic terminology we''ll be working
    with. In order to build up to the more advanced concepts in the book, we first
    lay the groundwork and expectations for the following chapters. This introductory
    chapter provides a preview of some of the concepts covered and prepares the reader
    with the necessary knowledge to be successful in  the sample projects and code
    to follow.'

    and You*, jumps right into one of the most essential concepts in game AI--the
    finite state machine. The chapter starts with a conceptual overview and then dives
    into an implementation of a state machine in Unity using the built-in features,
    such as Mecanim and StateMachineBehaviours. This chapter is the first to take
    the user through an actual example and sets the tone for how future chapters will
    explain the concepts they cover.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](25db39aa-6768-453c-855d-9f075da0e83e.xhtml), *Implementing Sensors*,
    builds on the concept of the AI agent by providing the reader the knowledge and
    techniques to make their AI more believable. In this chapter, the reader learns
    how to implement sensing for their agents, allowing them to collect data and information
    from their virtual surroundings, thus enabling more complex interactions with
    their environment. The output of the agent is only as good as the input, and this
    chapter ensures that the reader can implement sensing mechanisms to give AI behaviors
    solid inputs to base their algorithms on.'

    takes the reader''s knowledge to the next level. With the skills from the previous
    three chapters to build on, the reader is now given the tools to have their AI
    agent navigate the game world. A few different alternatives are explained in detail,
    such as node-based pathfinding, the near-standard A* algorithm approach, and finally,
    Unity''s NavMesh system. Examples are provided for each, and the user is given
    the necessary knowledge to pick the right approach for each situation.'

    covers the history and implementation of a standard flocking algorithm. Along
    with some history on the topic, the user is walked through a sample project that
    implements flocking to create convincing boid systems to model birds, fish, locusts,
    or any other flocking behavior. In the later portion of the chapter, the reader
    is introduced to implementing simple crowd dynamics using Unity''s NavMesh system.
    Once again, sample scenes are provided to illustrate the different implementations.'

    showcases another handy tool in the AI game programmer''s tool belt: the behavior
    tree. The chapter teaches readers the concepts behind behavior trees, walks them
    through a custom implementation, and applies the knowledge learned in two examples:
    a simple math-based example and a more fun and frankly silly example we call HomeRock,
    which emulates a popular online card game to showcase behavior trees in action.'

    to Make Your AI Seem Alive*, sets the stage with a long and descriptive title,
    right? This chapter covers the fundamental concepts in fuzzy logic and the approach
    for converting fuzzy values to concrete values and explains a simple approach
    for implementing fuzzy logic in Unity. The first example illustrates the simplest
    possible version of the concepts, and the second example illustrates a morality/faction
    system like you''d find in an RPG to illustrate the usefulness of fuzzy logic.'

    Together*, takes concepts the reader has learned throughout the book and throws
    them into a sample tower defense example project. This chapter illustrates how,
    by taking a handful of AI techniques, you can quickly throw together a game that
    implements AI NPCs and enemies and gives them rudimentary decision-making abilities.'

    these concepts a bit daunting. Be sure to follow the instructions closely, and
    examine all the provided sample code thoroughly. AI can be a daunting subject,
    and while this book aims to make you feel comfortable with the core concepts,
    it's OK if you need to read an example more than once to fully understand all
    the nuances.
