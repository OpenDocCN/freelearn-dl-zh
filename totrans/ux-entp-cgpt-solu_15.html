			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor260" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Any product person who gets this far in the book has probably accepted that the generative AI space is far more complex than simply asking ChatGPT a question and expecting a good answer. What it can do is impressive, but it’s frustrating when it doesn’t do what is expected. The key here is whether it was <em class="italic">known</em> that it could have been more helpful. In many places, customers will need to learn or recognize if ChatGPT, in its air of confidence, was lying. That is why product people are the gatekeepers for quality.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">This final chapter will take a different approach at a straight summary, focusing on what we did through other views of the world and a few ways of thinking about a generative AI journey:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Applying learnings to the new frontier</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Double-checking what feels right</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Build processes that fit the solution</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Wrapping up the journey</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor261" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Applying learnings to the new frontier</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">The book followed a traditional life cycle approach<a id="_idIndexMarker863" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to applying user experience design methods, practices, heuristics, and guidance to the emerging field of generative AI. Even though the chapters align with an order for a development process, many of these tools and techniques can be used throughout the generative AI journey. User research is done up-front to unlock value for future features and is again deployed once solutions allow validation. We hope to instill <em class="italic">the care and feeding approach is an absolute</em> with generative solutions. One would think it is an absolute with many software products, but the industry needs to be more enamored with the approach. There are issues with companies picking up releases that change rapidly. Sometimes, it impacts training and is disruptive to services. Generative AI can support a continuous improvement process, just like Google search, which is updated without a decision by the user. Since generative AI follows the conversational AI boom in the early 2010s, there is already a broad understanding of why most AI-infused solutions failed. They were thrown over the wall to customers, and a care and feeding practice of constant improvement was not followed. Now, generative intelligence fills in some of the technical shortcomings of previous chatbot solutions and can apply most of that learning, such as the teachings in this book, to create more effective generative AI products and services.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In hindsight, most of the time was spent on interactive conversational AI products while ensuring the building blocks provided could work for all recommendation-type solutions. Whether prioritizing support tickets or sales leads, scoring a marketing lead, establishing a user reputation, suggesting the next best step, filtering content based on harmful or undesirable content, or classifying sentiment to encourage good agent behavior, this book should have the guidance needed to solve those problems. The backend services that AI might improve will only need some of our approaches, but now an arsenal of techniques are available to<a id="_idIndexMarker864" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> apply to any situation.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">To be fair to the process, don’t apply every method to every project. Use some simple math from <a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em>, to calculate that every tool and technique has its return on investment. Pick and choose the battles with development or the powers that be. Use resources wisely. Do what feels right.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor262" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Double-checking what feels right</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">I attended an AI conference and listened to a talk on AI readiness. Given our discussion about when to deploy a solution and all the steps to make an AI solution successful, it would be helpful to see how others view what we have covered. Ann Maya presented the six tenets of AI readiness that Michael Bachman of <strong class="bold">Boomi</strong> (<a href="https://boomi.com" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://boomi.com</a>) created in partnership with 250 C-level executives<a id="_idIndexMarker865" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I bring up their tenets because they summarize much of our approach slightly differently and align nicely with putting in place a process (from <a href="B21964_10_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring and Evaluation</em>) that can enable these tenets. It is always valuable to compare methods and practices to how others work. It might feel less innovative if what you do aligns with what others are doing. However, there is also value for our collective to be on the right journey in an emerging space. Even with alignment, there are places to learn about missing pieces to the puzzle that provide value. I show the results they shared in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.1</em>. It summarizes the six tenets of AI readiness.</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – The six tenets of AI readiness.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Given our UX slant on AI readiness, these<a id="_idIndexMarker866" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> tenets don’t cover everything, but there is enough overlap that it was nice to find this resource right before I finished this book’s draft. Let me align each goal and their explanation with our efforts in this book. These are not in any specific order.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor263" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Set clear goals</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">From implementation to stewardship, knowing what you want and what you’re capable of doing with AI </em><em class="italic">is essential.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We defined this<a id="_idIndexMarker867" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> by discussing use cases (<a href="B21964_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identifying Optimal Use Cases for ChatGPT</em>) in a way that made sense for customers’ needs. Stay within reach. Focus on where AI can provide the most value and improve quality, then thoughtfully branch out. Companies will only do some of it, which is why there is a wealth of tools and support for implementation. The question is whether the best use cases are tackled to justify the cost.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor264" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Know your processes</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Document, catalog, create, manage, and maintain workflows and </em><em class="italic">business processes.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The Wove case study in <a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Gathering Data – Content is King</em>, touched on aligning goals and core expertise with what AI tools can do. A design process can reevaluate if steps in a current process are needed. Maintaining the workflow was the key to <a href="B21964_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Prompt Engineering</em>, and fine-tuning in the next chapter. Take the time to get these solutions right. They do not just magically work out of the box. Some current processes are ripe for re-imagineering. Occasionally, a team can ripe up a process and start from a clean slate. Mapping where to go might give a path forward. Sometimes, value comes from simple incremental improvements. You now know how to score these values, and using Agile, you can determine their costs. <strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First</strong> is the decision-making<a id="_idIndexMarker868" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> process.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Consider the different models that can improve the processes. Examples like Hub and Spoke or Chaining came up a few times. As prices come down, it becomes practical and expected that multiple models can be used to solve a single problem. Different models, with different capabilities, intelligence, performance, and costs, can be adapted for unique use cases. It is not one size fits all. The generative AI process justifies some consideration, as covered in <a href="B21964_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor236" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><em class="italic">, Process</em>. As it is not uncommon for an enterprise solution to have dozens or hundreds of parts, expect a proliferation of models in the enterprise. This makes the entire care and feeding life cycle more critical.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor265" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Know the data</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Understand the value of data, where the data lives, and how it’s generated, refined, secured, </em><em class="italic">and governed.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_06_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Gathering Data – Content is King,</em> addressed managing data for bespoke <a id="_idIndexMarker869" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>ChatGPT solutions. Without enterprise data, there is no added value. It is essential to build a RAG process that keeps business data secure and presents it in the right light.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The enterprise data is the entire reason for this book. It contains the collective wisdom for the company, the products and services, and the relationship with its customers. This is why it is so valuable. It also means being aware of inherent biases. It is not just about possible cultural biases; it could be just how the knowledge speaks about products or the terms it uses. Decide how to manage that data, deal with the governance of the data, and adapt it to allow AI to take full advantage of the corpus.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor266" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Align and be accountable</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Stakeholders should understand expectations and work together as good stewards of data </em><em class="italic">and processes.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We often discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker870" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> being good stewards of the model and data. Handling bias, controlling for PII, and managing integrations are critical to success. As all UX partners are, being customer advocates sets the right expectations. Using the methods from the first few chapters, evaluating how it is going by following <a href="B21964_09_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Guidelines and Heuristics,</em> and measuring the results reviewed in <a href="B21964_10_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring and Evaluation</em>, aligns stakeholders to common goals.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If ethical considerations<a id="_idIndexMarker871" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> come into play, be accountable for the outcome. The approaches discussed around checking results, using prompt engineering to talk in the best tone, and returning the most accurate answers are critical. Some mistakes by big players will start to make the news. In Hollywood, the saying goes, “<em class="italic">There is no such thing as bad publicity.</em>” Keep tight control over use cases that expose ethical, medical, societal, or community standards issues. Don’t be in the news for the wrong reasons.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor267" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Prioritize thoughtfully</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Establish and balance priorities critical to the business, corporate values, and </em><em class="italic">societal impact.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scoring Stories</em>, covered our scoring method for prioritizing the backlog using a customer-centric approach. As UX professionals, we focus on the value provided to customers, but as a proxy, we sometimes align with business, corporate, and societal goals. Let’s assume that the <a id="_idIndexMarker872" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>customer’s goals help achieve those priorities. It reminds me of a book commonly read in business school and one required by my professors. The key was the ability to answer three questions: <em class="italic">when to change</em>, <em class="italic">what to change to</em>, and <em class="italic">how to cause a change.</em> I hope you see the similarity in our approach to figuring out what to work on, how to work on it, and what the outcome should be. The book, <em class="italic">The Goal</em>, made for fine reading; it was compelling enough to read in one night.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Book: <a href="https://amzn.to/3WJqWHM" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/3WJqWHM" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://amzn.to/3WJqWHM</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Not surprisingly, this novel’s protagonist adopts an iterative approach. However, it is based in a factory setting (the software industry wasn’t the powerhouse it is today when this book was written). I still encourage it for a<a id="_idIndexMarker873" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> thoughtful and enjoyable read.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261" class="calibre9"><a id="_idTextAnchor268" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Automate with intention</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Implementing AI without understanding processes or data can lead to inefficiencies and </em><em class="italic">introduce risk.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21964_05_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining the Desired Experience</em>, covered this by figuring out thoughtful applications for our AI solutions. Make good decisions so the AI solutions provide the most value. Don’t over-AI. Pick your battles. Create value.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are many ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker874" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>approach AI solutions, ChatGPT integrations, and problem-solving with generative AI. However, all the best approaches do so<a id="_idIndexMarker875" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> thoughtfully, focusing on creating <strong class="bold">Functional, Usable, Needed, and Effective</strong> (<strong class="bold">FUN-E</strong>) experiences. Let’s do it with the right goals that follow a path to build a process that fits customer needs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor269" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Building processes that fit the solution</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">We talk about bringing the solution<a id="_idIndexMarker876" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to the customer, not forcing the customer to go to the solution. This takes many forms and many paths that follow this mantra:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Talk in the customer’s language and refrained from forcing them to learn how we speak.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Use prompt engineering and fine-tuning to align with the customer, and do not expect the customer to align with us.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Review how to deploy a solution, bringing AI where they need it. It might be on Slack, Teams, Discord, or a web channel. This could also be via several messaging apps, a web service, and a desktop or mobile app, all with slightly different capabilities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">To accommodate these solutions, processes must allow these engagements. Solutions need to span multiple channels, each with slightly different needs. The customer might have different expectations of those channels. Text, images, and links on a simple messaging platform might support more robust interactions for the same goals when deployed on a rich web experience. Also, only some steps will come from generative AI solutions. The best successes will come by breaking down use cases into the steps that are best solved with specific solutions. <em class="italic">Sometimes</em>, that will include an LLM. Process flows were discussed many times in the book, and we were able to take a peek into Wove’s process, which included generic and fine-tuned models. Consider the examples of models used in chains, such as the hub and spoke model to route to specific tasks and LLMs, branching to support different tasks, or looping through the same model with different prompts. These are just a few available variations. There is no one correct model. Each will require design effort, testing, validation, and a care and feeding process. Each is an application suite itself. This is unsurprising, as many enterprise solutions might comprise dozens or hundreds of systems and services.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">As product owners, designers, and thought leaders, we should <em class="italic">bring the solution to the customer, not the customer to the solution</em>. This will help us wrap up our journey.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor270" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Wrapping up the journey</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">There was a lot of ground to cover; will these skills, methods, practices, heuristics, and recommendations that will remain true three to five years from now? Sure, OpenAI will change<a id="_idIndexMarker877" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> its Playground, and a few links will stop working (the online references will be updated), but the concepts will live on for a while. The goal for OpenAI is to eliminate the considerable work needed with prompt engineering; when that happens, recycle the book and retire to the beach. However, for the foreseeable future, there is work to do.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">And maybe you noticed we didn’t once discuss ChatGPT’s <em class="italic">enterprise</em> tools. Of course, they have new tools coming soon, and a few select companies would be early adopters. What OpenAI can provide is likely valuable and even necessary but not sufficient. Some of this is already part of any plan, like the public APIs, multi-factor authentication, batch APIs for offline workload, encryption, and single sign-on (SSO). The ecosystem still has plenty of maturities left for OpenAI, third parties, and enterprise companies to address.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The concepts in this book will outlive the models used in these examples. Apply this learning to the latest models available.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Since the goal is to have up-to-date knowledge and wisdom, the book’s online references will be monitored to ensure they continue working. Even during the writing process, references had to be retired. Our collective goal is to move our customers toward wisdom. It is insufficient to regurgitate or push only data or information to consumers of our generative AI solutions. Our knowledge and ability to use generative AI should allow us to impart <em class="italic">wisdom</em> in solutions. I don’t recall where I found the pyramid in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.2</em>.</p>

			<p class="calibre3">Let’s take an example anyone can appreciate. There is plenty of <em class="italic">data</em> on how tall mountains<a id="_idIndexMarker878" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> are across the world. However, it is intriguing for a climber to know that Mt. Everest is the tallest mountain in the world and has two climbing routes. <em class="italic">Knowledge</em> from previous <a id="_idIndexMarker879" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>climbers’ experience (and some basic physiology) tells us that summiting typically requires oxygen (bottled and carried by the incredible Sherpas). However, there is a more important reason why those who summit use Sherpas. If they listen<a id="_idIndexMarker880" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> to their sage advice (<em class="italic">wisdom</em>), they are in the best position to succeed. If they don’t accept the Sherpas’ collective wisdom, tragedy can strike. This slide is shared so it can be adapted to any use case.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/blob/main/Chapter12-WisdomPyramid.pptx" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">Wisdom Pyramid slide</a> (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/blob/main/Chapter12-WisdomPyramid.pptx" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UX-for-Enterprise-ChatGPT-Solutions/blob/main/Chapter12-WisdomPyramid.pptx</a>)</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Figure out how to give customers the wisdom they need to be successful. Don’t just give them the same data in a new way. There is value to unlock by giving wise advice. Also, don’t be constrained by AI. Wisdom can be provided without AI.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Time to consider what is next for AI. Rapid changes are everywhere. With all the effort to research this book, it is fun to think about what is next for generative AI in enterprise solutions. What will the next few years bring prior to Skynet? Time to pontificate<a id="_idIndexMarker881" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> about the future:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="calibre8">Open-source models and portable models that protect PII will become more plentiful. The downside is that with that protection comes the inability to learn how to improve them. Opt-in programs that allow data sharing for “improvement” purposes will be the norm. Always have this option: pay or credit customers for this privilege. Learning is fundamental.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Prompt engineering will become easier as more effort is placed into the foundation models for broader intelligence. Writers and designers will have the limelight here, but its criticality will diminish over time.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">As enterprise applications move deep into AI, second-tier services will blossom. Secondary use cases and less critical business needs can leverage these now-standard services to AI-enable more of the business life cycle. Yes, it will be just about everywhere.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Failures will still exist and continue to be news. Lawsuits beyond data scraping will be expected. However, just like errors from human agents, errors and subsequent lawsuits will be reduced as hallucinations are minimized.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Once we pass the hype cycle by the start of 2027, the need to explain that AI is behind the scenes will stop, as it will be the norm. The biggest jumps in AI improvements for this cycle have already happened. By 2025, we will enter a phase of incremental improvements until the next major cycle by 2031.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">The AI revolution will be bigger than the web revolution. It will be used in every part of daily life and is as common as a smartphone, spanning every walk of life far beyond the web and the Internet. AI can benefit billions of less fortunate people. Crop yields, water management, more affordable healthcare, supply chain optimization, disaster predictions, and education are all critical and will align with governments that fund these areas.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">Although it will eliminate some jobs, it will also generate more valuable opportunities for the next generation. This is not a stretch, given the speed of adoption. Every technological revolution, from the wheel to the internet, requires society to adapt. We are still smarter, in many ways, than AI.</li>
				<li class="calibre8">In my lifetime, we will finally<a id="_idIndexMarker882" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> see home robots that can serve as general-purpose assistants (cook, clean, and fold laundry). The robot revolution, with vision analysis and LLMs, will come together in the next ten years. I suspect the same can be said for some hard day labor roles, as machine vision being used to pick fruit exists and will get better when robots are controlled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">I encourage engaging with me and the whole AI community. There is so much for UX people of all types to learn about what our data science and engineering friends are doing, and while learning from them, we can impart a wealth of value to their practices, hopefully with some of the wisdom imparted in this book. Connect, share, and engage.</p>
