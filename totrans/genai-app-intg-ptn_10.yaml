    thoughtful design and implementation throughout the entire AI lifecycle. Several
    key factors contribute to making AI systems fair. First and foremost is the quality
    and diversity of the training data. Ensuring that the dataset represents a wide
    range of demographics, experiences, and perspectives helps to minimize bias and
    promote equitable outcomes. This involves not just collecting diverse data, but
    also carefully curating and balancing it to avoid over- or under-representation
    of certain groups, ensuring AI systems don’t perpetuate or amplify biases. While
    aiming for fairness is crucial, it’s complex to implement. Different definitions
    of fairness can conflict with each other. For example, achieving demographic parity
    might not always align with equal opportunity. Overcompensating for historical
    biases could potentially create new forms of discrimination. For instance, an
    AI hiring system can be so focused on demographic parity that it overlooks genuine
    qualifications, potentially leading to more capable candidates being overlooked.'
