    down a sentence into its grammatical components, such as nouns, verbs, and phrases.
    This can help an LLM understand the grammatical structure of sentences, which

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Training LLMs presents several challenges that can affect the quality and applicability
    of the resulting models. Overfitting and underfitting are two primary concerns,
    along with several others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Overfitting** occurs when an LLM learns the training data too well, including
    its noise and outliers. This typically happens when the model is too complex relative
    to the simplicity of the data or when it has been trained for too long. An overfitted
    model performs well on its training data but poorly on new, unseen data because
    it fails to generalize the underlying patterns appropriately. To combat overfitting,
    techniques such as introducing dropout layers, applying regularization, and using
    early stopping during training are employed. Data augmentation and ensuring a
    large and diverse training set can also prevent the model from learning the training
    data too closely.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Underfitting** is the opposite problem, where the model is too simple to
    capture the complexity of the data or has not been trained enough. An underfitted
    model performs poorly even on the training data because it doesn’t learn the necessary
    patterns in the data. Addressing underfitting might involve increasing the model
    complexity, extending the training time, or providing more feature-rich data.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we laid out a comprehensive pathway for training LLMs, beginning
    with the imperative stage of data preparation and management. A robust corpus
    – varied, extensive, and balanced – is the bedrock upon which LLMs stand, requiring
    a diverse spectrum of text encompassing a broad scope of topics, cultural and
    linguistic representations, and temporal spans. To this end, we detailed the significance
    of collecting data that ensures a balanced representation and mitigates biases,
    hence fostering models that deliver a refined understanding of language.

    annotation come into play to refine the quality and utility of data. These steps
    remove noise and standardize the text, breaking it into tokens that the model
    can efficiently process and annotate to provide contextual richness.

    expanding the scope of the data and standardizing it, thereby enabling the model
    to learn from a broader spectrum and prevent overfitting. The validation split
    underpinned the model’s tuning process, ensuring its performance is robust, not
    just on the training set, but also on novel, unseen data.
