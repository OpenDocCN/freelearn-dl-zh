			<p>Artificial intelligence is experiencing unprecedented growth, with new models emerging daily. With over 20 years in the technology sector, I can attest that the pace of innovation has never been this fast. This brings not only opportunities but also considerable change. Navigating these changes can be challenging and costly, as you may invest a lot of time learning a new technology that might <span class="No-Break">become obsolete.</span></p>
			<p>Enter Microsoft Semantic Kernel – a framework that reduces these risks by enabling access to various AI services through popular programming languages. This framework spares you the details of grappling with constantly evolving APIs. By learning Microsoft Semantic Kernel, you can write code at the framework level, and the framework will call the underlying models for you. This allows you to focus on core concepts instead of the details of <span class="No-Break">each model.</span></p>
			<p>One of the key benefits of Semantic Kernel is its ability to use different AI services. For example, code initially targeting the OpenAI GPT platform can be switched to Google Gemini, often without any modifications. This flexibility makes it easier to integrate AI into applications and to make minimal modifications to them when change <span class="No-Break">inevitably happens.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, Semantic Kernel makes AI accessible to enterprise programming languages. While Python has long dominated the AI landscape, many enterprise applications rely on C# or Java. Recognizing this, Semantic Kernel not only supports Python but also elevates C# to a first-class AI language. Java support is currently in its beta stages and is expected to launch fully <span class="No-Break">in 2024.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you’re a solo developer or part of a larger enterprise, the demand to add AI functionality to applications is inevitable. This book was created to equip you with the necessary skills to implement AI quickly and effectively, ensuring you are well-prepared to meet this <span class="No-Break">growing demand.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The three main personas who are the target audience of this book are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Developers</strong> who want to add AI to their applications without adding the complexity of connecting to several different services and maintaining the connections after each release</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical program managers</strong> who can write some code and want to quickly prototype AI functionality without having to learn details</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Applied researchers and data scientists</strong> who want to focus their time on solving business problems quickly, instead of working on the ever-changing ways of connecting and using AI services</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B21826_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Microsoft Semantic Kernel</em>, introduces several AI concepts and gives a tour of what Semantic Kernel can help you achieve, showing you how to connect to an AI service and use it to achieve <span class="No-Break">a goal.</span></p>

			<p><a href="B21826_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor071"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Extending Semantic Kernel</em>, teaches you how to add functionality to Semantic Kernel, by adding <strong class="bold">native functions</strong> and <strong class="bold">semantic functions</strong> that can later be reused by you, as a developer, or your user to achieve <span class="No-Break">their goals.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21826_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Performing Complex Actions by Chaining Functions</em>, shows you how to use several functions of a kernel in sequence, making programming complex actions a <span class="No-Break">lot easier.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21826_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Programming with Planners</em>, explores how Semantic Kernel can receive a request in natural language and automatically decide which functions to call to achieve an objective, allowing users of your application to perform functions that you did not have to write <span class="No-Break">code for.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21826_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Adding Memories to Your AI Application</em>, examines how to add external knowledge to the AI models used by Semantic Kernel, making it easier for AI models to remember recent conversations <span class="No-Break">and personalizations.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21826_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Real-World Use Case – Retrieval-Augmented Generation</em>, shows how to add a large amount of data to AI models, allowing them to efficiently use information that they have not been trained on, including very recent and <span class="No-Break">private data.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21826_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor143"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Real-World Use Case – Making Your Application Available on ChatGPT</em>, shows how to publish the application you wrote with Microsoft Semantic Kernel on OpenAI’s GPT store, making it instantly available to millions <span class="No-Break">of users.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Readers will have to be familiar with programming in either Python or C#, and familiar with creating and connecting to AI services on <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>
