<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-69">Boosting Day-to-Day Productivity with ChatGPT</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the main activities ChatGPT can perform for general users daily to boost their productivity. The chapter will focus on concrete examples of writing assistance, decision-making, and information retrieval with suggestions and prompts so that you can implement them on your own.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to use ChatGPT as a booster for the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Daily activities such as organizing agendas, meal prep, and grocery shopping</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generating brand-new text content</li>
<li class="bulletList">Improving your writing skills and adapting the same content to different audiences</li>
<li class="bulletList">Retrieving documentation and information for research and competitive intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-70">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">For this chapter, you will require a ChatGPT account. Refer to <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em> to see how to open a ChatGPT account.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-71">ChatGPT as a daily assistant</h1>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can serve <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>as a valuable daily assistant, helping you manage your tasks and streamline your workflow. It can optimize your daily routine by providing personalized assistance, thus saving you time and enhancing your efficiency.</p>
<p class="normal">At the time of writing this book, ChatGPT’s response comes with a series of features:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.1: Icons on the ChatGPT user interface</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>examine all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_02.png"/> icon will let ChatGPT read its response aloud.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_03.png"/> icon allows you to copy ChatGPT’s output.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_04.png"/> icons allow you to provide feedback to ChatGPT’s response for future improvements.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_05.png"/> icon allows you to use a new functionality of ChatGPT, <em class="italic">Edit in Canvas</em>. It allows you to edit ChatGPT’s response on a white canvas to further adjust it to your needs.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_06.png"/> icon allows you to change the model on the fly and re-generate the response with the newly selected model.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">These features make the whole user experience with ChatGPT more interactive and adjustable on the go. Let’s start with a general suggestion on how I could make my day more productive:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.2: An example of ChatGPT generating a productive routine</p>
<p class="normal">Another interesting <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>usage of ChatGPT in organizing my week is that I can use it as a meal prep assistant. Note that here I also asked for a specific table formatting:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.3: Meal prep for my working week generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Alongside meal prep, ChatGPT <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>can also generate a workout plan according to my requirements:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.4: Workout plan generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>also be a loyal and disciplined study partner. It could help you, for example, by summarizing long papers so that you gain an overview of the discussed topic or help you prepare for exams.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s say you are preparing for your mathematics exam using the university book titled <em class="italic">Mathematics for Economics and Business</em> by Lorenzo Peccati et al. Before diving into it, you might want to get an overview of the content and main topics that are discussed, as well as whether there <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>are prerequisites and – most importantly if I’m preparing for an exam – how long it will take to study it. You can ask ChatGPT for this:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a text message  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.5: ChatGPT providing an overview of a university book</p>
<div><p class="normal">Note</p>
<p class="normal">Always keep in mind that generative AI models like ChatGPT, if not provided with a specific context, might generate results that are based on the average. For example, the study time for such a book might vary a lot from student to student. This is the moment where prompt engineering – like a persona prompt or an iterative prompt – can be of great help so that you can narrow down the specialization of the model on your own, unique profile.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">It is important to remember that when it comes to questions about specific assets or personal information, we are increasing the risk of ChatGPT’s hallucination. </p>
<p class="normal">In fact, in the previous example, the model was able to answer since the synopsis of the book was clearly part of the training set, yet the model didn’t know the specific contents of the book as it’s not available on the web for free. If this is the case, it might be a good practice to enable the web search tool so that ChatGPT can navigate the web.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>an example of this:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.6: Example of ChatGPT invoking the web plugin</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, ChatGPT has now invoked the web plugin and searched five sites, also providing the links it navigated through.</p>
<p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>also ask ChatGPT to ask you some questions about the material you have just studied:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a chat  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.7: Example of ChatGPT acting as a professor</p>
<div><p class="normal">Note</p>
<p class="normal">The technique of <em class="italic">Act as… </em>is a great example of efficient prompting techniques, and it can be listed among the examples described in <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s look at <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>some more examples of using ChatGPT for more specific tasks, including text generation, writing assistance, and information retrieval.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-72">Generating text</h1>
<p class="normal">As a language model, ChatGPT is <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>particularly suited for generating text based on users’ instructions. For example, you could ask ChatGPT to generate emails, drafts, or templates that target a specific audience:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.8: Example of an email generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Another example <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>might be asking ChatGPT to create a pitch structure for a presentation you have to prepare (I’ll put only the first slide here as an example):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a white page  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.9: Slideshow agenda and structure generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>generate blog posts or articles about trending topics this way. Here is an example:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.10: Example of a blog post with relevant tags and SEO keywords generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">We can even <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>get ChatGPT to reduce the size of the post to make it fit for a tweet. This is how we can do this:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.11: ChatGPT shrinks an article into a Twitter/X post</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, ChatGPT can also generate video or theatre scripts, including the scenography and the suggested editing. In this case, we might want to incorporate some prompt engineering techniques <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>covered in the previous chapter, like context, desired outcome, and structure. Let’s, for example, consider the following prompt:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Write a short, humorous theatre dialogue for a 3-minute comedy sketch.
Context:
Setting: A coffee shop.
Characters:
Alex – Sarcastic, quick-witted, unimpressed.
Jamie – Overly dramatic, easily flustered, indecisive.
Scenario: Jamie attempts to order a simple black coffee but overcomplicates it with unnecessary details and existential crises. Alex, unimpressed, tries to keep things simple but unintentionally escalates the absurdity.
Desired Outcome:
A fast-paced and snappy comedic dialogue.
Filled with witty comebacks, misunderstandings, and exaggerated reactions.
Ends with an unexpected and absurd twist that makes the audience laugh.
Structure of Output:
Title: A catchy title that reflects the comedic theme.
Cast: List the characters.
Scene Description: Briefly describe the setting and mood.
Dialogue Format: Clearly labeled lines with stage directions in brackets (e.g., [Alex sighs]).
Ending: A punchy, unexpected comedic twist.
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at the result:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.12: Theatre dialog with scenography generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">I only provided <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>one scene out of the four generated by ChatGPT, to keep you wondering the ending…</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, whenever new content needs to be generated from scratch, ChatGPT does a very nice job of providing a first draft, which could act as the starting point for further refinements.</p>
<p class="normal">However, ChatGPT can also support pre-existing content by providing writing assistance and translation, as we will see in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-73">Improving writing skills and translation</h1>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, rather than generating new content, you might want to revisit an existing piece of text. It can <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>be for style improvement purposes, audience changes, language translation, tone, and so on.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at some examples. Imagine that I drafted an email to invite a customer of mine to a webinar. I wrote two short sentences. Here, I want ChatGPT to improve the form and style of this email since the target audience will be at the executive level:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a email invitation  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.13: Example of an email revisited by ChatGPT to target an executive audience</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>ask the same thing but with a different target audience:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a email invitation  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.14: Example of the same email with a different audience, generated by ChatGPT</p>
<p class="normal">ChatGPT can also give you some feedback about your writing style and structure.</p>
<p class="normal">Imagine, for <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>example, that you wrote an abstract for an essay titled <em class="italic">The History of Natural Language Processing:</em></p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">NLP</strong>) has evolved from rule-based models in the 1950s to today’s deep learning-driven AI systems. Early approaches relied on symbolic methods, later replaced by statistical models like hidden Markov models and n-grams. The 21st century saw a revolution with neural networks, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and transformer architectures (BERT, GPT), drastically improving language understanding. NLP now powers chatbots, translation, and AI-driven communication. This essay traces NLP’s evolution, highlighting key breakthroughs that have shaped its role in modern technology and AI.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now, you want some feedback about the writing style and its consistency with the title (truncated output):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_20.png"/>C</figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.15: Example of ChatGPT giving feedback on an introduction for an essay</p>
<p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>can see, not only has ChatGPT provided feedback and tips for the overall essay, but it has also given a modular analysis as requested in the prompt (relevance to the title, clarity, and engagement).</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s now unveil the last ChatGPT skill of the chapter. ChatGPT is also an excellent tool for translation. It knows at least 95 languages (if you have doubts about whether the language you need is supported, you can always ask ChatGPT directly). Here, however, there is a consideration that might arise: what is the added value of ChatGPT for translation when we already have cutting-edge tools such as Google Translate?</p>
<p class="normal">To answer <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>this question, we have to consider some key differentiators and how we can leverage ChatGPT’s embedded translation capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">ChatGPT can capture the intent. This means that you could also bypass the translation phase since it is something that ChatGPT can do in the backend. For example, if you write a prompt to produce a social media post in French, you could write that prompt in any language you want – ChatGPT will automatically detect it (without the need to specify it in advance) and understand your intent:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.16: Example of ChatGPT generating an output in a language that is different from the input</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">ChatGPT can capture the more refined meaning of slang or idioms. This allows for a translation that is not literal so that it can preserve the underlying meaning. For example, let’s consider the British expression <em class="italic">It’s not my cup of tea</em>, which indicates that something is not to one’s liking or preference. Let’s ask both ChatGPT and Google Translate to translate it into Italian:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a chat  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_22.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.17: Comparison between ChatGPT and Google Translate while translating from English into Italian</p>
<p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>can see, ChatGPT can provide several Italian idioms that are equivalent to the original one, also in their slang format. On the other hand, Google Translate performed a literal translation, leaving behind the real meaning of the idiom.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">As with any other task, you can always provide context to ChatGPT. So, if you want your translation to have a specific slang or style, you can always specify it in the prompt using, for example, delimiters to highlight the context placeholder (as we explored in <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>). Or, even funnier, you can ask ChatGPT to translate your prompt with a sarcastic touch. In the following example, I prompted ChatGPT with the Italian version of the following text:</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">OpenAI is a non-profit research organization focused on artificial intelligence, with the goal of promoting and developing friendly AI in a way that benefits humanity.</em></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Founded in late 2015, the organization, based in San Francisco, aims to ‘freely collaborate’ with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research publicly available.</em></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">The founders (including Elon Musk and Sam Altman) were partly motivated by the existential risks posed by artificial general intelligence.</em></p>
<p class="normal">And asked ChatGPT to translate it into English with a sarcastic tone:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_23.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.18: Example of ChatGPT translating a prompt with a sarcastic touch. The original content of the prompt was taken from OpenAI’s Wikipedia page: https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI</p>
<p class="normal">All these <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>scenarios highlight one of the key features of ChatGPT and OpenAI models in general. As we saw, these features are not meant to be specialized (that is, constrained) on a single task. On the contrary, they are meant to serve multiple scenarios dynamically so that you can address a wide range of use cases with a single model.</p>
<p class="normal">In conclusion, ChatGPT is able not only to generate new text but also to manipulate existing material to tailor it to your needs. It has also proven to be very precise at translating between <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>languages, keeping the jargon and language-specific expressions intact.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we will see how ChatGPT can assist us in retrieving information and competitive intelligence.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-74">Quick information retrieval and competitive intelligence</h1>
<p class="normal">Information retrieval and competitive intelligence are yet more fields where ChatGPT is a game-changer.</p>
<p class="normal">When we talk <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>about information retrieval, though, we need to differentiate between three main scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The retrieval that happens at ChatGPT’s knowledge level, meaning that that specific information requested by the user was part of the training set the model was trained on</li>
<li class="bulletList">The retrieval that happens when using the WebSearch plugin available in ChatGPT, which enables the model to navigate the web and retrieve up-to-date information</li>
<li class="bulletList">The retrieval that happens when using an external knowledge source that we upload to ChatGPT</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to focus on the first two scenarios.</p>
<p class="normal">One example involves asking ChatGPT to provide a quick summary or review of a book we might be interested in reading (in this case, the <em class="italic">Harry Potter</em> series is part of the model’s training set, hence its use in the first retrieval scenario):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a book  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_24.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.19: Example of ChatGPT providing a summary and review of a book</p>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, we could <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>ask for some suggestions for a new book we wish to read based on our preferences:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a book  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_04_25.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.20: Example of ChatGPT recommending a list of books, given my preferences</p>
<p class="normal">Now let’s go a <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>step further and consider a scenario where you might need up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="normal">You might want to quickly retrieve some references about a topic you want to learn more about – for example, feedforward neural networks. If this is the case, you can enable the <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>web search tool and see live hyperlinks as sources of information for ChatGPT:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.21: Example of ChatGPT listing relevant references</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, ChatGPT was able to provide me with relevant references to start studying the topic. Plus, if you click on the <strong class="screenText">Sources</strong> button, you can expand further recommendations of additional links to refer to:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.22: Additional links unveiled by the Sources button</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s go even <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>further in terms of competitive intelligence.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s consider writing a book titled <em class="italic">Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks – an Implementation with Python</em>. I want to do some research about the potential competitors on the market. The first thing I want to investigate is whether there are already some competitive titles around, so I can ask ChatGPT to generate a list of existing books with the same content:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.23: Example of ChatGPT providing a list of competitor books</p>
<p class="normal">You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>ask for feedback in terms of the saturation of the market you want to publish in:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_04_29.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.24: ChatGPT advising about how to be competitive in the market</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, ChatGPT can be <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>a valuable assistant for information retrieval and competitive intelligence. However, it is important to remember the knowledge base cut-off is 2021. This means that, whenever we need to retrieve real-time information, or while making a competitive market analysis for today, we might not be able to rely on ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="normal">Nevertheless, this tool still provides excellent suggestions and best practices that can be applied, regardless of the knowledge base cut-off.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-75">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">All the examples we saw in this chapter were modest representations of what you can achieve with ChatGPT to boost your productivity. These small hacks can greatly assist you with activities that might be repetitive (such as creating a template for responding to or creating a daily routine) or onerous (such as searching for documentation or competitive intelligence).</p>
<p class="normal">Note also that, in this chapter, we interacted with ChatGPT only via text: throughout the book, we will also see how to incorporate visual interactions.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to dive deeper into three main domains where ChatGPT is changing the game – development, marketing, and research.</p>
