    to give the robot ways to indicate problems back to you, along with selecting

    a robot is. We can explore some types of robots, along with basic principles that
    distinguish robots from other machines. You'll think a little about where the
    line between robot and non-robot machines is located, and then perhaps muddy that
    line a little bit with the somewhat fuzzy truth. We will then look at a number
    of robots built in the hobbyist and amateur robotics scenes.

    sensors. A software agent is a program that automatically processes input and
    produces output. Perhaps a robot is best described as an autonomous software agent
    with sensors and moving outputs, or it could be described as an electromechanical
    platform with software running on it. Either way, a robot requires electronics,
    mechanical parts, and code.
