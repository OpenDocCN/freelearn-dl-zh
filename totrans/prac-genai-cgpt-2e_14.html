<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-167"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">An overview of what we have learned so far</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">We started this book with an introduction to the concept of generative AI and its various applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">We saw how </span><a id="_idIndexMarker641"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">generative AI is about not only text but also images, video, and music.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">In </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Chapter 2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">, we moved on to look at the company that brought generative AI to its greatest popularity: OpenAI. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Founded in 2015, OpenAI mainly focuses its research on a particular type of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker642"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">generative model, </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Generative Pre-trained Transformer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">GPT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Then, in November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a free web app of a conversational assistant powered by GPT models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">It gained immense popularity, reaching one million users in just five days!</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">ChatGPT has been a game-changer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Its impact on daily productivity, as well as in various industry domains, is huge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">We also saw, in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Chapter 3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">, how to properly design the most important element when using generative models such as ChatGPT: the prompt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Prompts are the user’s input, nothing more than instructions in natural language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Designing prompts is a pivotal </span><a id="_idIndexMarker643"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">step to getting the maximum value from your generative models to the point where </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">prompt engineering </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">has become a new domain of study.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Once we got familiar with ChatGPT and prompt design, we moved on to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">, where we finally got concrete examples of how ChatGPT can boost your daily productivity and become your daily assistant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">From email generation to improving your writing skills, we saw how many activities can be improved thanks to the generative power of ChatGPT.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">But we didn’t stop there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">With </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Chapters 5, 6, 7</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">8</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">, we saw how ChatGPT can boost not only daily productivity but also domain-specific activities – for developers, from code generation and optimization to interpreting machine learning models; in the case of marketers, from new </span><a id="_idIndexMarker644"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">product development to improving </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">search engine optimization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">SEO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">); for researchers, from experiment design to the generation of a presentation based on a study; and for those needing an assistant for visual creativity, from design suggestions to images and canvas creation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Furthermore, in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Chapter 9</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">, we explored how all the previous ChatGPT capabilities (code generation, marketing research, and so on) can be further tailored by building highly specialized assistants called GPTs, leveraging OpenAI’s GPT Store. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">With GPTs, users can build personal assistants that leverage the power of the model behind ChatGPT, yet benefit from a more specialized and scoped behavior, leveraging knowledge bases, plugins, and precise instructions provided by users themselves – all without writing a single line of code!</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">With </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Chapter 10</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">, we shifted the conversation to the enterprise level, exploring how OpenAI’s models can also be consumed via APIs and embedded in custom applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">This allows both individuals and organizations to build powerful AI-infused apps, which benefit from OpenAI’s LLMs yet offer great flexibility in terms of backend application logic and frontend UI.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">This journey was </span><a id="_idIndexMarker645"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">meant to provide you with greater clarity about what we are talking about when we refer to popular buzzwords such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, and LLMs.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">However, in the next section, we will see how the incredibly fast AI developments in recent months are bringing brand-new technologies on top of what we have learned so far.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-168"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">It’s not all about OpenAI</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Throughout this book, we have covered “all things OpenAI.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">It’s well known that OpenAI was the first entrant </span><a id="_idIndexMarker646"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">in the landscape of generative AI. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">It is hard to argue that the launch of ChatGPT was the milestone that marked the so-called paradigm shift in the AI field, from two angles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">From a technological perspective, ChatGPT (or, more precisely, the model behind it – GPT-3.5-turbo) was the most powerful LLM out there by the time it was live (November 2022). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">This gave a competitive advantage to OpenAI, which was hard to benchmark for competitors.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">From a behavioral perspective, ChatGPT “broke the internet” in the sense that almost everyone was shocked by its ease of use and its extraordinary capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">This led to a new wave of users who, even though not AI experts, became interested in the matter and started exploring the endless capabilities of the product, raising the expectation bars more and more over the months.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Nevertheless, soon after November 2022, many other players entered the market and started populating the landscape of LFMs with new entries, both proprietary and open source.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Let’s explore some of the key players as of today.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-169"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Mistral AI</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">This France-based </span><a id="_idIndexMarker647"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">company has made significant strides in the generative AI landscape with its open-source models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Mistral AI is known for its Mistral 7B and Mixtral models, which have been praised for their performance and efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">The company focuses on creating highly capable models that are accessible to the broader AI community, promoting innovation through open-source contributions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">Their models are designed to handle a variety of tasks, from text generation to code completion, making them versatile tools in the AI toolkit.</span></p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-171"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Microsoft</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">As we covered in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Chapter 10</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">, Microsoft has leveraged its Azure platform to support the development and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker649"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">deployment of OpenAI through a multi-year partnership. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Microsoft has also made an entire catalog of other LLMs available via an API (both proprietary and open source) on its Azure platform.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">In addition to its partnerships, Microsoft has developed its own family of models known as the Phi series. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">The Phi-3 models, including Phi-3-mini, Phi-3-small, and Phi-3-medium, are designed to be highly efficient and cost-effective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">These models excel in various benchmarks, outperforming larger models in tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, coding, and mathematics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">The Phi-3-mini, for instance, supports a context window of up to 128K tokens, making it highly versatile for different applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">Microsoft’s focus on optimizing these models for deployment across various platforms, including Azure AI, Hugging Face, and local environments, ensures that they are accessible and practical for a wide range of users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.6">This commitment to developing robust, scalable, and efficient models highlights Microsoft’s significant contributions to the field of GenAI.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-172"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Google</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Google has been </span><a id="_idIndexMarker650"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">at the forefront of GenAI with its Gemini models, designed for multi-modal applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">These models can process and generate content across various formats, including text, images, and videos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Google’s innovations in </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">retrieval-augmented generation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">RAG</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">) have improved the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs by integrating real-time data from cloud databases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">This approach helps mitigate issues like hallucinations, ensuring that the generated content is both relevant and accurate.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-173"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Anthropic</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Anthropic has developed the Claude family of LLMs, which are known for their safety and ethical considerations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Claude models are designed to minimize biases and promote fairness, making them </span><a id="_idIndexMarker651"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">suitable for a wide range of applications. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Anthropic’s focus on responsible AI development has set a high standard in the industry, ensuring that its models are not only powerful but also aligned with ethical guidelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">This commitment to safety and transparency has made Claude a trusted name in the GenAI community.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">The proliferation of LLMs in the market of GenAI is increasing exponentially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">However, it is important to acknowledge that our choice of the “best LLM for our app” shouldn’t be routed toward the biggest (on average) highest-performing model available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">As of the time of writing, there are many LLMs that have been trained in a specific domain or expertise (like mathematical reasoning, code generation, specific languages, and so on) that, on average, perform way worse than general-purpose models like OpenAI’s o1. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">Nevertheless, we might consider different variables when it comes to developing our application.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">For example, we might be interested in a model that has a very specific comprehension of an industry-specific taxonomy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">If this is the case, we might want to leverage LLMs that have been trained and fine-tuned for this purpose, like Microsoft’s BioGPT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">Or, we might need to run our model locally, in disconnected scenarios (think about an offshore plant in the middle of the ocean); if this is the case, we couldn’t run, let’s say, GPT-4o – firstly, because it is a proprietary model and cannot be “downloaded”; secondly, would we have a supercomputer that is capable of hosting more than 100 trillion parameters?</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">There are many scenarios where models other than the “state of the art” are needed, and it’s part of the job of the new GenAI-related jobs to assess the type of model needed for specific use cases.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-174"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Ethical implications of generative AI and why we need responsible AI</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">The previous section highlighted how, alongside the widespread knowledge and adoption of generative </span><a id="_idIndexMarker652"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">AI technologies, a general concern is rising.</span></p>
