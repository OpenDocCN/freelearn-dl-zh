			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Simplifying Code Explanation, Optimization, Transformation, and Feature Development</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at the following <span class="No-Break">key topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explaining and <span class="No-Break">updating code</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Transforming code</span></li>
				<li>Developing <span class="No-Break">code features</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, we dived deep into how <strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer</strong> can help developers be more efficient by assisting them in auto-generating code based on different prompting techniques. In this chapter, we will expand on some other key features of Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<p>First, we will explore how Q can provide developers with explanations of existing code, even without them having prior knowledge of the code they are trying to understand. Next, we will examine how Q can help transform an existing code base from a lower version of the programming language to the desired upper version. In our case, we will focus on how Q transforms Java code. Finally, we will explore how Q can assist in developing new code features or making changes to existing projects. This is also a powerful component where you instruct Q in plain language about the feature you want the code to build, and Q will draw a plan first and then help generate code based on <span class="No-Break">that plan.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s dive straight into these three features of Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Explaining and updating code</h1>
			<p>With Amazon Q Developer, you<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> can effortlessly update your code base by requesting changes to a particular line or block of code. The tool will then generate new code that reflects the desired modifications, which you can seamlessly incorporate into the original file. This seamless integration ensures a smooth and efficient coding experience, allowing you to focus on writing high-quality code without the hassle of manually making <span class="No-Break">intricate changes.</span></p>
			<p>To better<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> understand this feature, let’s examine some existing code to witness the power of Amazon Q Developer firsthand. I’ve selected one of the Python code bases for learning from a public GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/jassics/learning-python">https://github.com/jassics/learning-python</a>. Feel free to experiment with your own code if you have any. This repository contains simple Python examples that will make it easier to grasp the capabilities of Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<p>To demonstrate this feature, we will use the VS Code IDE to clone this Git repository into the IDE workspace. We’ve opened the <strong class="source-inline">two_sum_index.py</strong> file in VS Code. The following screenshot displays <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – Sample Python code opened in VS Code IDE</p>
			<p>We assume that you have followed the instructions provided in <a href="B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> for installing the Amazon Q extension for <span class="No-Break">VS Code.</span></p>
			<p>To begin <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>using the <strong class="bold">Explain</strong> feature, you can select either the full code or just a portion of it, depending on what you would like to understand and change. The following screenshot shows the different options available for the selected code using <span class="No-Break">Amazon Q.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer199">
					<img alt="Figure 12.2 – Amazon Q – The Explain feature menu" src="image/B21378_12_2.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Amazon Q – The Explain feature menu</p>
			<p>Let’s go through each of them and see what exactly <span class="No-Break">they do.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Explaining code</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> you click the <strong class="bold">Explain</strong> option with the code selected, Amazon Q will try to summarize for you what the logic does in the code. This can be extremely handy for developers when opening a large code file developed by someone else, especially if there is not a lot of documentation related to the code. So, in essence, with just a click of a button, Q instantly explains to you what the code is <span class="No-Break">all about.</span></p>
			<p>As soon as you hit the <strong class="bold">Explain</strong> option, Q will first show you the section of the code you selected for explanation, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – Amazon Q – the Explain feature menu</p>
			<p>If you scroll down a bit in the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: CHAT</strong> window, the first thing you will notice is that Q tries to provide you with a gist of what the logic is all about. In this case, it identified that this logic solves the two-sum problem. The following screenshot shows the <span class="No-Break">initial explanation.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – Amazon Q – key aspects of the solution</p>
			<p>As you can see, the<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> task of understanding someone else’s code, which sometimes can take days, if not weeks, was accomplished in a matter of seconds by Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Refactoring code</h2>
			<p>Many developers, in <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>the rush of meeting deadlines, do not follow all the best practices of coding—especially code readability and efficiency. The <strong class="bold">Refactor</strong> option in Amazon Q accomplishes exactly that immediately, without the developer having to put much effort <span class="No-Break">into it.</span></p>
			<p>When we select the same code that we picked in the <em class="italic">explain</em> section for refactoring, this is the response we receive in the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CHAT</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> window.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer204">
					<img alt="Figure 12.7 – Amazon Q – refactored code" src="image/B21378_12_7.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.7 – Amazon Q – refactored code</p>
			<p>It will <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>provide you with a version of the refactored code. Keep in mind it may not always meet the standards you have set or what your organization has set. It is important for the developer to either accept the whole refactored code as is or pick and choose what they feel sets a high bar <span class="No-Break">for them.</span></p>
			<p>If you scroll down the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: CHAT</strong> window, to make the developer’s life easier, it also provides in detail all the changes it made in the refactored code so that they get a good handle on why it proposed those changes. The following screenshot shows the list of changes Q made for its version of the <span class="No-Break">refactored code.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p>The next option <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>available is a lifesaver for <span class="No-Break">many developers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Fixing code</h2>
			<p>Code and<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> bugs go hand in hand in the field of software development, and developers often spend substantial time trying to identify and fix bugs in the code. Amazon Q Developer provides an option to fix bugs right within the IDE with just a click of <span class="No-Break">a button.</span></p>
			<p>In the code that we have used in this chapter so far, let’s introduce a small bug. In the code where you see <strong class="source-inline">while index &lt; length</strong>, let’s change it to <strong class="source-inline">while index &gt; length</strong> instead. Now, from the Q menu inside the IDE, if you click on the <strong class="bold">Fix</strong> option, as always, first, Q will show you the code snippet that you have asked to find and fix the bug from. The following screenshot shows our code with the error <span class="No-Break">we introduced.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer206">
					<img alt="Figure 12.9 – Amazon Q – selected buggy code" src="image/B21378_12_9.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.9 – Amazon Q – selected buggy code</p>
			<p>Amazon Q will analyze <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>the code and look for issues in the logic. Keep in mind that syntactical errors are easy to catch, as the IDE itself will highlight and prompt you to change the syntax. However, in our case, we introduced a logical error, which can be harder to catch, and you may have to go through the entire <span class="No-Break">debugging process.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows that Q caught the logical error and provides you with what might be the issue in <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer207">
					<img alt="Figure 12.10 – Amazon Q – bug explained" src="image/B21378_12_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10 – Amazon Q – bug explained</p>
			<p>After it provides<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> what the issue was, it goes ahead and provides the fixed code. The following screenshot shows the new code that <span class="No-Break">Q provided.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer208">
					<img alt="Figure 12.11 – Amazon Q – fixed code" src="image/B21378_12_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.11 – Amazon Q – fixed code</p>
			<p>There are a few things to observe in the fixed code: it also made some other recommended changes, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer209">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.12 – Amazon Q – fixed code explanation</p>
			<p>Just a reminder<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> again: as the developer, you should read through the change summary carefully and only accept the recommendations that align with what you are looking for. Not every change or recommendation may be appropriate for your case, so it is important to understand and acknowledge that Q is trying to make the developer’s life easier, and not necessarily replace the job of <span class="No-Break">the developer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Optimizing code</h2>
			<p>The code written<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> by developers solves a particular use case; it doesn’t mean that this code is the most optimal way to solve the problem. In other words, there might be other ways to code a particular logic that would enhance the performance when executed. To assist with this, there is also an <strong class="bold">Optimize</strong> option in the Q menu. So, after we accepted our fixed code from the previous section, we ran the <strong class="bold">Optimize </strong>option just to see whether there were any better ways to code the <span class="No-Break">same problem.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows that Q found some tweaks that would enhance the performance of our code even further. Keep in mind that you may or may not want all <span class="No-Break">recommendations</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker510"/></span><span class="No-Break"> provided.</span></p>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.13 – Amazon Q – the code Optimize suggestion</p>
			<p>Immediately after the explanation, Q will provide the new optimized code for you to review. The following screenshot shows the version Q provided for you <span class="No-Break">to consider.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.14 – Amazon Q – optimized code</p>
			<p>As always, it <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>will then go ahead and explain why it made those code changes so that the developer gets a better handle instead of trying to decipher the new <span class="No-Break">logic themselves.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights the reasons for <span class="No-Break">those optimizations.</span></p>

			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>final option available in the menu is <strong class="bold">Send </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">to prompt</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Sending code to prompt</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Sending to prompt</strong> simply<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> puts the code you highlight into the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: CHAT</strong> panel so that the developer can ask any questions related to that logic. For example, we selected the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop from our code and asked Q what it was doing, and Q was able to explain the logic. Of course, you can continue the chat process to something <span class="No-Break">more meaningful.</span></p>

			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> were able to see how Amazon Q Developer is easily able to explain and update code right from inside the IDE. This feature goes a long way in helping developers <span class="No-Break">save time.</span></p>
			<p>Before we wrap up this section, a new feature was recently released that makes it easy for developers to ask questions across the entire project in the IDE. Let’s quickly look at this <span class="No-Break">workspace-related feature.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Workspace context code awareness</h2>
			<p>So far in this<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> section, we have been working with features that helped us explain, optimize, refactor, and fix code within a particular file that was open in the IDE. However, with this new feature inside Amazon Q Developer, the chat in the IDE can answer questions related to the entire workspace, not just for the file that’s open in <span class="No-Break">the IDE.</span></p>
			<p>Q Developer seamlessly ingests and indexes all code files, configurations, and project structures, equipping the chat with a thorough understanding of your entire application within the IDE. When you open the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: CHAT</strong> within the IDE and ask a question by including <strong class="source-inline">@workspace</strong> first, the index related to your project is created and locally stored. Initially, it may take up to 20 minutes for the index to be created. After that, the index is incrementally updated as your workspace adds new files or updates existing <span class="No-Break">code files.</span></p>
			<p>Before<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> asking workspace-related questions in the chat, you also have the option to configure specific workspace settings in the IDE. The following figure highlights navigating to the Q Developer settings inside the VS <span class="No-Break">Code IDE.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer214">
					<img alt="Figure 12.17 – Amazon Q Developer settings inside the VS Code IDE" src="image/B21378_12_17.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.17 – Amazon Q Developer settings inside the VS Code IDE</p>
			<p>Once you open the settings, you can enable the workspace index flag, enable the GPU flag, and provide specific threads for indexing, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following figure.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer215">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.18 – Amazon Q Developer – workspace-related settings inside the VS Code IDE</p>
			<p>Once the indexing<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> is complete, you can start asking broader questions that span across the whole workspace. For the project example we have used in this section around Python fundamentals, we want to understand what else is inside this project. The following screenshot highlights the use of <span class="No-Break">workspace-level chat.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer216">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.19 – Amazon Q Developer – workspace-related question in the Chat tab</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>also ask specific questions about any implementation that may exist in any files across the entire project, and Q Developer will find it and explain in detail where the code exists and what it does. The following screenshot highlights one such specific question we asked at the workspace level, and Q Developer searched through the project and presented us with the information we were <span class="No-Break">looking for.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer217">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.20 – Amazon Q Developer – workspace-related specific question in the Chat tab</p>
			<p>This powerful <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>feature can boost developer productivity by scanning the entire project and providing context-aware answers. You can imagine its usefulness in large projects that may contain hundreds of modules and thousands of files <span class="No-Break">with code.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s move to another key feature of Amazon Q, where it can assist developers in transforming an entire project from one version of the code base to an <span class="No-Break">updated version.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Transforming code</h1>
			<p>Perhaps <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>one of the most powerful features of Amazon Q Developer is its ability to transform your entire project into an upgraded version of the programming language used for building the project. The reason is simple. Imagine a large, important project in your organization that was built with an older version of the programming language. In software engineering, there is a popular saying: <em class="italic">If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it</em>. Many projects tend to prolong upgrading their projects as they’re working just fine for the intended <span class="No-Break">business purpose.</span></p>
			<p>However, as <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>new versions of programming languages are released, support for older APIs starts becoming deprecated. Sometimes, organizations fall so far behind in upgrades that they have to spend a significant amount of time, money, and resources to create an intermediate upgrade path before they can reach the <span class="No-Break">final version.</span></p>
			<p>Now, imagine if instead of spending months to upgrade a project, you could do so in just minutes. This is the power of Amazon Q Developer, and we will walk you through the whole transformation process with an example in <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon Q Developer provides an agent for code transformation inside the IDE when you install the Q extension. The agent is called the <strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer Agent for code transformation</strong>, and we will see it in action with the VS <span class="No-Break">Code IDE.</span></p>
			<p>But first, let’s make sure we understand some of the prerequisites required <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Prerequisites for code transformation using Amazon Q</h2>
			<p>At the<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> time of writing this book, only Java projects written in Java 8 or 11, built with Maven, are supported to be upgraded to Java 17. However, we are at the very infancy stage of generative AI-powered assistants, so keep an eye out in the future as other programming languages, versions, and build types may also come along. AWS has also announced that .NET transformation is coming soon, which will enable the migration of such applications from Windows to Linux faster. The link in the <em class="italic">References</em> section captures <span class="No-Break">this announcement.</span></p>
			<p>There are some other nuances on what the current version of the Amazon Q Developer Agent for code transformation can and cannot do. Since it’s an ever-evolving topic, instead of listing it here, I have added a link to the official documentation in the <em class="italic">References</em> section at the end. Always make sure you understand the prerequisites and other limitations of any service before <span class="No-Break">using it.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>How code transformation using Amazon Q works</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>Amazon Q Developer Agent for code transformation upgrades the code language version of your project by generating a transformation plan. This plan includes new dependency versions, major code changes, and replacements for deprecated code. The process involves building your project locally to create a build artifact, which must be under 1 GB. Amazon Q then uses this artifact to generate a customized transformation plan in a <span class="No-Break">secure environment.</span></p>
			<p>The transformation process involves upgrading popular libraries and frameworks to versions compatible with Java 17, updating deprecated code components, and iteratively fixing errors by running existing unit tests. After transformation, Amazon Q provides a summary detailing the changes made, the status of the final build, and any <span class="No-Break">issues encountered.</span></p>
			<p>You can review a file difference to see the proposed changes before accepting them. The transformed code remains available for up to 24 hours after the <span class="No-Break">transformation completes.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s see this Amazon Q’s code transformation magic <span class="No-Break">in action.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Code transformation example</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>pick a sample public project hosted on GitHub. The project can be found using the following link: <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/qct-sample-java-8-app">https://github.com/aws-samples/qct-sample-java-8-app</a>. This project is built with Java 8 and meets all the prerequisites for transforming it to Java 17 using Amazon <span class="No-Break">Q Developer.</span></p>
			<p>The first thing we will do is use a supported IDE. In my case, I am using VS Code, to clone this repository to my local folder. If you plan to try this feature on your project, it will also be a great learning curve <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>This particular project contains a Maven wrapper (<strong class="source-inline">mvnw</strong> for macOS or <strong class="source-inline">mvnw.cmd</strong> for Windows). In this case, Amazon Q will use this wrapper to proceed with the transformation process without having to worry about other Maven dependencies. However, if you have a Java project with Maven build, make sure your <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file is available in the root folder of the project and all your <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> files are present in the <span class="No-Break">project directory.</span></p>
			<p>Also, note that it is important that you have the correct version of Java and Maven on your local system where you are using the IDE. Many issues arise due to incorrect versions or incorrect paths of the required software. Since I am building this project on macOS, I exported the Java path directly into the <strong class="source-inline">mvnw</strong> wrapper file and tested the build process with the <strong class="source-inline">clean install</strong> command, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot.</span></p>

			<p>We have concluded the transformation feature of Amazon Q Developer and hope you now have a good sense of how much of a productivity boost it would provide for transforming <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>bigger and more complex projects in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s move on to another key component of Amazon Q Developer that we had planned to cover in this chapter: <span class="No-Break">feature development.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Developing code features</h1>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> Amazon Q Developer Agent assists in developing code features or making changes to projects within your IDE. By describing the feature you want to create, Amazon Q uses the context of your current project to generate an implementation plan and the necessary code. It supports building AWS projects or your <span class="No-Break">own applications.</span></p>
			<p>To begin, open a new or existing project in your IDE. Amazon Q uses all files in your workspace root for context. Enter <strong class="source-inline">/dev</strong> in the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: CHAT</strong> panel to open a new <strong class="bold">Chat</strong> tab, where you can interact with Amazon Q to generate an implementation plan and new code for your feature. The best way to understand this would be with <span class="No-Break">an example.</span></p>
			<p>In our previous section, we transformed the Java-8-based project into Java 17 code. Now, let’s assume that the organization has decided that it will be a good time to add some new functionality to the project along with the upgrade rollout. To get this done, you can follow the old-fashioned full SDLC process or just call Amazon Q Developer <span class="No-Break">to assist.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s assume that in the Java project that we earlier upgraded in the transformation section, we have been asked to add a new OAuth-based authentication page, where the users will be presented with a new logic page and the authentication will be triggered at the backend using a REST API endpoint. The objective of this functionality is to implement a token-based authentication module for <span class="No-Break">extra protection.</span></p>
			<p>Developers truly know the difficulty of this task; firstly, they must understand all the places in the project that will be affected by this new functionality. After that, they need to know all the new logic they have to create and how to lay it all out in the project. It takes a lengthy but systematic approach to get all the pieces in place before something can <span class="No-Break">be coded.</span></p>
			<p>With Amazon Q Developer, an agent is available when you install the Q extension in the IDE. The agent is called <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>the <strong class="bold">Amazon Q Developer Agent for software development</strong>. The sole purpose of the agent is to take on this tedious task of adding a new feature in the project, in minutes instead of weeks <span class="No-Break">and months.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at how <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>we can get started with this task in the VS Code IDE with the same Java project we used for code transformation. Hit the <strong class="bold">Q</strong> icon from the left panel of the IDE and type in <strong class="source-inline">/dev</strong> followed by the description of the feature you want <span class="No-Break">to build.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot highlights <span class="No-Break">this aspect.</span></p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer233">
					<img alt="Figure 12.36 – Amazon Q feature development – ask Q what you want to build" src="image/B21378_12_36.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.36 – Amazon Q feature development – ask Q what you want to build</p>
			<p>To maximize the benefits of Amazon Q feature development capabilities, some best practices need to be followed. Firstly, provide a detailed description of the new feature or code changes you want to implement, including specific objectives and outcomes. This helps Amazon Q generate a comprehensive implementation plan and the necessary code changes. Also, limit your feature to updates affecting no more than five files at a time. Requesting Amazon Q to handle larger changes might compromise the quality and manageability of the feature’s implementation. If the file difference shows modifications to numerous files, consider narrowing the scope of your <span class="No-Break">feature description.</span></p>
			<p>Once you request what feature you want to develop, Q will create a very detailed plan that lays down all the steps, including files where the logic will be created, what the logic will do, what functions it will add, different imports it will perform, whether the class file will be new or a modification to an existing one, and will also provide test <span class="No-Break">case generation.</span></p>
			<p>The next few<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> series of screenshots will show you the plan the Amazon Q Developer Agent for software development came up with. The following screenshot highlights the creation of a new class file for implementing the user model along with the <span class="No-Break">authentication service.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.37 – Amazon Q feature development – plan Steps 1 and 2</p>

			<p>Finally, the <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>following screenshot shows the last step of the plan, where it even proposes to add integration test logic. As you have seen from the plan, Q does a thorough job of following the best practices of building software. Instead of developers spending weeks to come up with this plan, Q did it <span class="No-Break">in minutes.</span></p>

			<p>The creation of <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>the plan is cool by itself, but what’s even cooler is the fact that the Q agent can auto-generate all this logic by itself and place it in the project for you to review and accept. The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Generate code</strong> button offered at the end of the plan in the <strong class="bold">AMAZON Q: </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CHAT</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> window.</span></p>

			<p>However, as <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>always, it’s good practice to review the changes before committing. When you open the code files, the IDE will present the before and after changes side by side, allowing you to compare them. Some files were added as brand new in the process, so the agent generated the entire class file based solely on the feature <span class="No-Break">development request.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows a side-by-side comparison of the code before and after the change. This gives you a chance to review it before committing and pushing it to the <span class="No-Break">code repository.</span></p>

			<p>This was just <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>one example of how the feature development component of Amazon Q Developer can speed up developer productivity. Give it a try to generate many more features for your real-world projects in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<p>With this, we have come to the end of this <span class="No-Break">important chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered three important components of Amazon Q Developer: code explanation and update, code transformation, and <span class="No-Break">feature development.</span></p>
			<p>The code explanation feature allows developers to understand the logic in the code by providing explanations. This makes it easier for them to comprehend the code and make necessary updates. Additionally, this feature enables developers to refactor, optimize, and fix code directly within the IDE. We also looked at how Amazon Q Developer can answer questions for the whole project with the workspace <span class="No-Break">context-aware feature.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we explored the code transformation feature, which enables Q to upgrade Java projects from version 8 or 11 to version 17 in a matter of minutes. The agent responsible for transformation analysis generates a detailed transformation plan and implements the necessary changes for developers to accept and commit in the <span class="No-Break">code repository.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we examined the feature development component of Q, where developers can request Q to build new features in the project by describing the use case in the chat. The software development agent in Q analyzes and devises a detailed plan for updating the existing project to incorporate the <span class="No-Break">new feature.</span></p>
			<p>All these features of Amazon Q Developer tremendously boost the productivity of developers. In the next chapter, we will explore another crucial aspect of software development: code scanning for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
