    you find the different functionalities of n8n. You will also learn about the different
    kinds of nodes in n8n and how to use them. You will then learn about building
    workflows and dealing with dynamic data to handle different kinds of scenarios.
    You will finally create your first workflow in n8n.

- en: Workflows are a collection of nodes in n8n. Workflows can range anywhere from
    two nodes to hundreds of nodes, with workflows calling sub-workflows. These workflows
    can then be saved in n8n's database and activated to run on their own in the background
    even when you do not have the n8n Editor UI open.

    potential of n8n is evident when you begin to connect these nodes. In n8n, you
    can join one node to many other nodes. Workflows don't necessarily have to follow
    a linear structure.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we learned about n8n's Editor UI. We then learned about the
    two types of nodes in n8n. We then covered expressions to reference dynamic data
    in n8n workflows and learned more about workflows in n8n. Finally, we created
    our first workflow in n8n by putting together knowledge of the Editor UI, nodes,
    expressions, and workflows. We'll use the principles that we've learned throughout
    this chapter to build workflows that will handle the backend of our products.
    An understanding of these topics will help with building workflows of any complexity
    in n8n.

    n8n 中的工作流程。最后，我们通过结合编辑器 UI、节点、表达式和工作流程的知识，创建了我们的第一个 n8n 工作流程。我们将利用本章学到的原则来构建处理我们产品后端的工作流程。对这些主题的理解将有助于在
    n8n 中构建任何复杂程度的工作流程。

    n8n so powerful. We will then take a look at how n8n workflows share data between
    themselves and learn how to access that information.
