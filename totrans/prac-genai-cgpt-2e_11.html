<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-126">Exploring GPTs</h1>
<p class="normal">In the previous chapters, we saw several examples of how to leverage ChatGPT for various activities, from personal productivity to marketing, and from research to software development. For each of these scenarios, we always faced a similar situation: we started with a general-purpose tool as ChatGPT, to then tailor it with domain-specific questions and additional context.</p>
<p class="normal">However, sometimes this might not be enough if our aim is to obtain an extremely specialized model for our own purposes. That’s why we might need to build a <em class="italic">purpose-specific ChatGPT</em>. Luckily, OpenAI itself has developed a no-code platform to build these customized assistants, which are called GPTs.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we are going to go through GPTs’ features, capabilities, and real-world applications, covering the same use cases we saw in previous chapters so that you can see the difference in the output’s quality. Plus, we will also see how to publish your GPT and make it a production application not only for yourself but also for others.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Understand what a GPT is and what kinds of tasks it can achieve</li>
<li class="bulletList">Build your own GPT without writing a line of code</li>
<li class="bulletList">Publish your GPT and integrate it with external systems</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s start with some basic definitions and then jump into the practice.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-127">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To access and utilize GPTs within ChatGPT, a ChatGPT Plus subscription is required. At the time of writing this book, this subscription is priced at $20 per month.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-128">What are GPTs?</h1>
<p class="normal">In November 2023, OpenAI introduced GPTs, specialized versions of ChatGPT designed to enhance <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>productivity and cater to specific tasks and needs. Unlike the general-purpose ChatGPT, these custom versions allow users to create tailored AI models without any coding knowledge.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">There is an important consideration that will be relevant throughout this chapter. When we mention the word GPT, there are two main definitions that you will find in this book.</p>
<p class="normal">The first one refers to the proper <strong class="keyWord">Generative Pre-trained Transformer</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GPT</strong>) model architecture behind OpenAI’s language models. We mentioned this architecture in Part 1, and we know that this is the framework behind ChatGPT itself.</p>
<p class="normal">The second one refers, in a more generic way, to the specialized assistants that OpenAI allows users to create in a no-code approach. With GPTs, OpenAI refers to specialized versions of ChatGPT. In this context, a single GPT refers to one assistant that you create leveraging the platform (available to all users with ChatGPT Plus).</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, whenever you read GPT or GPTs, keep in mind that we are using the second definition.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The idea of GPTs is like that of AI agents. In fact, with GPTs, we are building entities powered by LLMs, with specific instructions, providing them with both a custom knowledge base and a set of tools or plugins to interact with the surrounding environment.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see these components in more detail. First of all, you can have a comprehensive look at all existing GPTs that have been publicly published. To do so, you can navigate through the following page:<a href="https://chatgpt.com/gpts"> https://chatgpt.com/gpt</a>s.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.1: Landing page of GPTs</p>
<p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>can see from the preceding picture, this is a marketplace of all existing GPTs. You can explore it by category (box 1) or by explaining what you are looking for in the search bar (box 2).</p>
<p class="normal">Then, to create your own GPT, you can navigate through th<a href="https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor">e https://chatgpt.com/gpts/edit</a>or page and log in with your OpenAI account. Alternatively, you can go to ChatGPT and click on <strong class="screenText">Explore GPTs</strong> in the top-left corner of the page, then <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> (as illustrated in box 3 in the preceding picture).</p>
<p class="normal">Once in the editor, you will be asked to configure your GPT, while on the right-hand side, you can test it in real time.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.2: Editor page to create your GPT from scratch</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>explore all the components:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Name</strong>: The name you want to give to your GPT.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Description</strong>: A description of the capabilities of your GPT. This is extremely important, especially if you are going to publish your GPT on the marketplace so that other users can find it easily (as we previously mentioned, GPTs can be searched for via natural language in the Search GPTs bar. Plus, this description will also help other users to know what the GPT is used for.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Instructions</strong>: This is the system message of your GPT, that is, a set of instructions in natural language that tailor the assistant to your specific need and that the final user doesn’t see.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Conversation starters</strong>: This is a set of sample prompts that users could start with to interact with the GPT and gain confidence in using it.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Knowledge</strong>: This refers to the custom documentation we can ground the model on. When we upload documents here, our GPT will be able to navigate through them with the retrieval augmented generation pattern, so that we can provide additional knowledge or even limit our assistant’s responses to the custom knowledge base, depending on our needs.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Capabilities</strong>: These refer to a set of built-in plugins we can provide the GPT with, without <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>writing a single line of code. You can see from the above picture that there are three plugins out of the box:<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Web Browsing</strong> for searching the web and retrieving up-to-date information</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">DALL-E 3</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Image</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Generation</strong> to generate illustrations</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Code Interpreter &amp; Data Analysis</strong> to execute code in a sandboxed Python environment and interact with analytical files (like spreadsheets)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>: Actions can be seen as plugins as well; however, they differ in capabilities since they are not built in, but rather specified by the GPT developer. For example, you might generate an action, which looks as follows:<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">In the context of actions, you can get support from a specialized GPT that is natively integrated into the configuration pane by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Add Actions</strong> and then <strong class="screenText">Get help from ActionsGPT</strong>.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.3: Example of how to get support from ActionsGPT</p>
<p class="normal">By doing so, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>be presented with the ActionsGPT interface:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.4: Landing page of ActionsGPT</p>
<p class="normal">It’s amazing <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>to see how we are witnessing a “GPT inside a GPT,” don’t you think?</p>
<p class="normal">In addition to the standard configuration page, there is another option to build your GPT in a more “conversational way.” In fact, you can switch to the tab <strong class="keyWord">Create</strong> and explain, in natural language, what you want to achieve with your GPT:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Screens screenshot of a chat  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.5: Creating a GPT starting from a conversation in natural language</p>
<p class="normal">We will <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>see both methods – standard configuration and conversational configuration – in the practical sections of this chapter.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know what a GPT is, let’s see how to create one. Over the next sections, we will create five different GPTs:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The first four will specialize in the four domains we already covered with the general-purpose ChatGPT – personal productivity, code development, marketing, and research. The idea is to compare the overall efficiency and accuracy of a domain-specific GPT versus a general-purpose ChatGPT.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The fifth one will cover a new domain, related to artistic creativity. We will leverage the built-in DALL-E plugin as well as other plugins developed by design companies (like Canvas).</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s start with boosting our personal productivity with a specialized GPT.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-129">Personal assistant</h1>
<p class="normal">In this scenario, we are going to build a GPT to boost our gym workouts. To do so, we will leverage <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>the built-in plugins. Plus, we will add some relevant documents so that the assistant will be grounded on a specific knowledge base.</p>
<p class="normal">My goal is to have an assistant that can build workout plans according to my fitness ambition, availability, gender, age, preferences, and so forth. I also want my assistant to provide me with clear explanations of the reason behind its proposals.</p>
<p class="normal">To accomplish all of this, I want to make sure that my assistant will:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Ask me specific questions it needs to design the best workout for me</li>
<li class="bulletList">Provide me with relevant information and sources regarding its responses</li>
<li class="bulletList">Consider my feedback, but be able to maintain its stance if it believes it is correct for me</li>
<li class="bulletList">Not accommodate my requests if they are not reasonable or risky to my health</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s see how to create this GPT, following all the configuration steps mentioned in the previous section:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="keyWord">Name</strong>: I’ll call my assistant WorkoutGPT.</li>
<li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Description</strong>: This is the description I set: “Workout Assistant that helps users designing their workout plan according to their needs.”</li>
<li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Instructions</strong>: Here we get to the real core of our GPT. This is the set of instructions I provided the GPT with:<p class="normal"><em class="italic">“You are a workout AI assistant that helps users by creating their workout plans, depending on their needs.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Before generating the plan, make sure to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Fitness goal and time expectation</li>
<li class="bulletList">Age and gender</li>
<li class="bulletList">Fitness level</li>
<li class="bulletList">Availability for the workout</li>
<li class="bulletList">All other elements that you need in order to define a proper workout plan (e.g. equipment, potential injuries...)</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">If needed, use the provided documents to enrich your responses.</p>
<p class="normal">If the user suggests something to you that is not plausible for their goal, stick to your assumption, explaining the reasons behind it politely.</p>
<p class="normal">If the user asks you something that might be risky for their health, politely suggest that they take an easier and alternative approach, explaining the reasons behind it.”</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4"><strong class="keyWord">Conversation starters</strong>: Here, I set three examples of different workouts:<ul>
<li class="bulletList">I want to train for a marathon in 6 months.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generate a 30’ HIIT workout plan without any equipment.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generate a 45’ weightlifting workout plan with dumbbells only.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Knowledge</strong>: Here, I uploaded <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>the standard <strong class="keyWord">National Strength and Conditioning Association </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">NSCA</strong>) training load chart, a tool used to help athletes and coaches determine the appropriate training load for different exercises and training sessions. It looks like the following:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A chart with numbers and symbols  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.6: NSCA training load chart. Source: https://www.nsca.com/contentassets/61d813865e264c6e852cadfe247eae52/nsca_training_load_chart.pdf</p>
<p class="normal">I almost forgot a key step – adding an illustration! It might seem superficial but having an icon for your GPT makes it more attractive, especially if you are planning to publish it to all users. Luckily, we have DALL-E directly integrated into the configuration pane:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.7: Example of how to set your GPT icon</p>
<p class="normal">This is <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>what the configuration looks like:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.8: WorkoutGPT configuration page</p>
<p class="normal">Great! Let’s now see some sample conversations.</p>
<p class="normal">To start <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>with, let’s pick the first conversation starter about marathon training:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.9: Example of questions asked by WorkoutGPT to assess the user’s overall goals and fitness level</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, our WorkoutGPT immediately asks us for the required information to proceed with <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>the plan. Once provided with the above information, my assistant generated the following 24-week plan (I’ve shared here just the first 4 weeks):</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.10: Example of workout table for marathon training generated by WorkoutGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Plus, it specifies the Friday strength training as follows:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A white and black list with black text  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.11: Example of strength training generated by WorkoutGPT</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s focus <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>on the strength training. I want to better understand how to calibrate the weights. The following figure shows the first part of the response:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.12: Example of WorkoutGPT explaining how to determine the weight to lift in a strength workout</p>
<p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>same response, the assistant also references the NCSA training load chart provided as a knowledge base:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a load chart  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.13: Example of WorkoutGPT retrieving information from a custom knowledge base about the NSCA training load chart</p>
<p class="normal">Now I want <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>to challenge my WorkoutGPT, asking for something that might be harmful to me. For example, preparing for a marathon with no experience in one month is definitely a terrible idea. Let’s see what my assistant’s thoughts about it are, once I provide it with a list of answers to its starter questions:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.14: Example of WorkoutGPT gently nudging the user to pivot their goal and expectations given the risks associated with the request</p>
<p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>can see, my WorkoutGPT is nudging me to change my approach to the race. While it is still providing me with a running workout plan for 3 weeks (here, the output is truncated), it is not focused on preparing me to run a marathon in under 3 hours and 15 minutes, but rather on building endurance and strength.</p>
<p class="normal">Note that if <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>we had asked the same thing to the general-purpose ChatGPT, it would have responded as follows:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a message  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.15: Example of ChatGPT fulfilling a user’s request despite the associated risk</p>
<p class="normal">Note how ChatGPT, despite being vocal in disclosing its concerns, is still accommodating my request, providing me with a plan to run a full marathon. That could encourage me – a reckless beginner who thinks that running a marathon is a joke – to dive into this silly adventure, with serious consequences for my health.</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, GPTs allow you to be extremely specific about how your assistant should behave and what they should avoid saying or accommodating.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-130">Code assistant</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, I want to develop an assistant that is tailored toward data science projects. More <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>specifically, I want my assistant to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Provide clear guidance on how to set up a data science experiment, given the user’s task.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Generate the Python code needed to run the experiment.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Leverage Code Interpreter’s capabilities to run and check the code.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Push the final code to the GitHub repository.<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">When it comes to code generation, custom GPTs can offer significant advantages over general-purpose ChatGPT. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge and tailored instructions, custom GPTs can produce code that is more accurate, efficient, and aligned with specific requirements. This customization allows the model to understand and adhere to coding standards, frameworks, or libraries pertinent to a given project, reducing the likelihood of errors and the need for extensive revisions. Plus, thanks to actions, GPTs can actually execute activities that, if automated in the development lifecycle, can speed up the time to market of your products.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s see how to do that step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Setting the instructions:</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">This GPT is a data science assistant that helps users set up and run data science experiments. It provides clear guidance on how to define and organize tasks and generates the Python code needed for the experiments, and leverages Code Interpreter’s capabilities to run and check the code. The GPT will take the user’s input and provide step-by-step instructions to structure the experiment, create the necessary scripts, and execute the code.</em></p>
<p class="normal">The GPT will execute the code to see whether it works. Once the final code is accepted by the user, it can be pushed to the GitHub repo as a <strong class="keyWord">.ipynb</strong> file.</p>

<li class="numberedList" value="2">Setting the (optional) conversation starters:<ul>
<li class="bulletList">How do I set up a classification experiment?</li>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Creating an <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>action to communicate with GitHub: To do so, we need to click on <strong class="screenText">Create new action</strong> and define the required schema.<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">To set the schema of a ChatGPT action using the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification, you define the structure of the data (requests and responses) that the action will handle. This involves specifying the schema property under content in your API paths. The schema outlines the expected data types, required fields, and possible values for your request and response bodies.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Here are the steps to define a schema:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Identify the data structure: Determine the type of data the action will handle (e.g., JSON objects or arrays).</li>
<li class="numberedList">Define properties: Under the schema, specify the properties, their types, and any constraints. For example, if the action requires a username and an email, you’d define these under the properties.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set required fields: Use the required array to specify which fields must be provided.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Apply to paths: Place the schema under the appropriate HTTP method in your paths (e.g., POST or GET).</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Let’s consider the following example:</p>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Following these <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>instructions, we are now ready to set up our experiment. We want to tackle the well-known Titanic passengers’ survival prediction. We will upload our dataset (you can find many free versions online; I downloaded mine f<a href="https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv">rom https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic</a>.csv) and leverage a logistic regression model.<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The Titanic survival prediction task is a classic problem in data science and machine learning. The goal is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not, based on features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more. This task is typically used to teach classification techniques, where the model is trained on a labeled dataset and then used to predict outcomes on new data. The challenge involves selecting relevant features, handling missing data, and choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm to achieve accurate predictions.</p>

<p class="normal">That’s pretty cool! It is extremely accurate and can save a lot of time. Plus, if you think about data scientists <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>working in large enterprises on many projects, having a similar assistant can also help in following fixed standards among projects, so that the maintenance is aligned across teams.</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, it is imperative to keep a subject matter expert in the loop (in this case, a data scientist), as we need to verify not only the output but also the reasoning process.</p>
<p class="normal">The last thing <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>that we will ask our GPT is to push the code on our repo. Let’s see how it works:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_29.png"/></figure>

<p class="normal">And it worked! Again, this is an example of how GPTs can speed up developers’ and data scientists’ productivity. Designing data science experiments following a common framework and enabling <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>push workflows without the need to switch to GitHub can save precious time, so that data scientists can focus on the core aspects of their projects.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-131">Marketing assistant</h1>
<p class="normal">As we saw in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, AI assistants can be extremely valuable when it comes to this domain. In fact, generating <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>text content – like social media posts, blog articles, or marketing campaigns – is probably the activity in which these models perform at their best.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Definition</strong></p>
<p class="normal">A copywriter is a professional who specializes in writing persuasive and engaging content, often for marketing and advertising purposes. Their work typically includes writing promotional materials such as advertisements, brochures, websites, emails, social media posts, and other forms of content designed to persuade an audience to take a specific action, like making a purchase or subscribing to a service.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to create a copywriter assistant that is tailored to this kind of activity. To do so, I named my assistant Copywriting Companion, and I set the following configuration components:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Instructions:</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Copywriting Companion is a versatile assistant designed to help users with various writing tasks. It specializes in generating product sheets based on user input, including text and images, crafting email campaigns for newsletters or promotional purposes, creating engaging visuals for new products, and writing tailored social media posts for different platforms.</em></p>
<p class="normal">When executing tasks, it makes sure to validate your thought process and reason step by step.</p>
<p class="normal">It ensures content is persuasive, engaging, and aligned with the target audience, aiming to <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>increase engagement and promote products or services effectively. The assistant adapts its style to the user’s needs and strives for creativity, clarity, and relevance in all outputs. It communicates in a casual, friendly tone, making interactions feel approachable and easygoing.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">Conversation starters:</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Can you write a product description for my new product?</em></p>
<p class="normal">I need a catchy headline for an article about climbing</p>
<p class="normal">Give me a few ideas for a blog post about running</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Capabilities:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close-up of a white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.31: Copywriting Companion’s enabled plugins</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see it in action:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">I’ll first ask <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>it to write a product sheet starting from a picture provided (output truncated):</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.32: Example of Copywriting Companion generating a product description</p>
<p class="normal">As a copywriter, I might want to insert this set of information into a more structured repository, like an <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>Excel file. Let’s ask the assistant to do so, leveraging its Code Interpreter plugin:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A white background with black text  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_33.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.33: Example of Copywriting Companion converting its previous response into an Excel file, leveraging the Code Interpreter plugin</p>
<p class="normal">This is the final result:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.34: Excel file generated by Copywriting Companion</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">Let’s now <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>ask the assistant to generate an Instagram post to sponsor our shoes:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_35.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.35: Example of Copywriting Companion generating an Instagram post</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, the assistant also proposed an image description to leverage the DALL-E plugin. Since <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>the description makes sense to me, I’ll go ahead and ask it to generate it:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_36.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.36: Example of Copywriting Companion generating an image leveraging the DALL-E plugin</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Finally, I want to get an idea of how big competitor brands – like Nike and Adidas – are doing <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>their marketing activities. To do so, I’ll ask my assistant to gather some evidence from the web:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_37.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.37: Example of Copywriting Companion doing a competitive analysis leveraging the Web Browsing plugin</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, our companion correctly leveraged the Web Browsing plugin to retrieve the required information. Plus, it gave us powerful insight into which areas the two competitor companies are investing in, so that we might think (or ask our companion) about unique differentiators that could help our brand stand out in a competitive market.</p>
<p class="normal">We could also <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>go a step further and ask for more specific insights about the competition by leveraging the Code Interpreter &amp; Data Analysis plugin. Let’s say, for example, that we created an Excel sheet with the following structure:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_38.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.38: Competitive analysis on an Excel sheet</p>
<p class="normal">Now we want to generate some visuals out of it. Let’s ask our Copywriting Companion to do so:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a graph  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_39.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.39: Example of bar chart and scatter plot generated by Copywriting Companion</p>
<p class="normal">Here <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>are more visuals:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Screens screenshot of a graph  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_40.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.40: Example of a line chart generated by Copywriting Companion</p>
<p class="normal">As requested, the <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>executive report is also generated:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close-up of a document  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_41.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.41: Example of an executive report generated by Copywriting Companion</p>
<p class="normal">Overall, tailoring ChatGPT for marketing activities can be extremely useful when it comes to generating <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>new content, designing marketing strategies, and doing competitive analysis on the web.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-132">Research assistant</h1>
<p class="normal">In this scenario, we are going to focus on research once more, but this time with a particular focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>paper retrieval. More specifically, we want our assistant to be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Retrieve information from the custom knowledge base that we provide.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Integrate the custom documents with papers only from arXiv, enabling the web plugin for this task.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Retrieve from a database (in our case, it will be hosted in Notion) existing ongoing work from other researchers, so that we don’t risk covering content in an essay that has already been covered by someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s see all the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Upload custom documents. For this purpose, I’ll use two papers about image classification in machine learning: <em class="italic">“CIFAKE: image classification and explainable identification of ai-generated synthetic images” </em>by J. Bird et al. and <em class="italic">“A Comprehensive Study of Vision Transformers in Image Classification Tasks”</em> by Khalis et al.</li>
<li class="numberedList">You can upload them in the relevant section in the configuration pane:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B31559_09_42.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.42: Uploading custom documents in the configuration pane</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>custom documents with web references. To do so, we need to enable the web plugin:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close-up of a white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_43.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.43: Enabling the Web Browsing plugin in the configuration pane</p>
<p class="normal">Plus, we also need to specify that the assistant should only navigate through the arXiv archive. We will see how to specify that in the set of instructions we will create.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Retrieve information from a Notion database. Here, the idea is that, as researchers, we might come up with ideas that are already being studied and developed by our fellow colleagues. Imagine that we keep track of all the ongoing research in a Notion database that has the following structure:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A white background with black text  Description automatically generated" src="img/B31559_09_44.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.44: Notion database structure</p>
<p class="normal">To do so, we need <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>to create GPT actions. To do so, there are two steps to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li class="alphabeticList" value="1">In your Notion workspace, you need to create a new connection marked as internal, and a new internal integration secret (or API key) will be created. You can call this connection “chatgpt” or similar.</li>
<li class="alphabeticList">In your GPT configuration pane, you need to set a new action schema. Since in our case we need to query a specific database, the schema will look like the following. When it comes to authentication, you can click on <strong class="screenText">Authentication</strong> and choose <strong class="screenText">API Key</strong>. Enter the information below:<ul>
<li class="bulletList">API Key: Use the internal integration secret from your newly created connection in Notion.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Auth Type: Bearer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-133">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we explored how to get customized GPTs to address our specific goals. The possibility of tailoring ChatGPT opens a new landscape of scenarios, where highly specialized AI assistants become the everyday companions of professionals. Plus, OpenAI offers a no-code UI to create GPTs, so that all citizen developers can benefit not only from the extended marketplace of available solutions but also from their own creations.</p>
<p class="normal">With the plugin’s extensibility and the custom knowledge base, custom GPTs can serve you for limitless tasks. Then, with the addition of powerful actions, they can also communicate with the surrounding environment and evolve from <em class="italic">mere</em> generation to automation.</p>
<p class="normal">With this chapter, we also conclude <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, where we focused on practical applications of ChatGPT. Starting from the next chapter, we are going to cover in more detail how large enterprises can leverage OpenAI models and embed them into their business processes.</p>
