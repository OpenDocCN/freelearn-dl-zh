<p>Learning how to apply AI is crucial and can take the fun factor to the next level when developing traditional, educational, or any other kind of game. Unreal Engine is a powerful game development engine that allows you to create 2D and 3D games. If you want to use AI to extend the life of your games and make them challenging and more interesting, this book is for you.</p>
<p>The book starts with breaking down <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) into simple concepts to get a fundamental understanding of it. Using a variety of examples, you will work through actual implementations designed to highlight key concepts and features related to game AI in UE4. You will learn how to work through the built-in AI framework to build believable characters for every genre (e.g. RPG, Strategic, Platform, FPS, Simulation, Arcade, and Educational games). You will learn how to configure <em>Navigation</em>, <em>Environmental Querying</em> and <em>Sensory</em> systems for your AI agents and couple it with <em>Behavior Trees</em>, all with practical examples. You will then explore how the engine handles dynamic crowd. In the concluding chapters, you will learn how to profile, visualize and debug your AI systems, to correct the AI logic, and increase performance.</p>
<p>By the end of the book, your AI knowledge of the built-in AI system in Unreal will be deep and comprehensive, allowing you to build powerful AI agents within your projects.</p>

<p>This book is for you if you are a game developer with a bit experience in Unreal Engine, and now want to understand and implement believable game AI within Unreal Engine. The book will be both in Blueprint and C++, allowing people from every background to enjoy the book. Whether you're looking to build your first game or to expand your knowledge as a Game AI Programmer, you will find plenty of exciting information and examples of game AI in terms of concepts and implementation, including how to extend some of these systems.</p>

<p><a href="42076317-364e-4824-a8b7-cc2c418f021e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Moving the First Steps in The AI World</em>, explores the prerequisites to becoming an AI game developer and how AI is used in the game development pipeline.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="e8c4d8a9-579e-4e38-b02a-a9002f1c48ce.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Behavior Trees and Blackboards</em>, introduces you to two principal structures used within the Unreal AI framework, which are used to control most AI agents in games. You will learn how to create a <em>Behavior Tree</em> and how these can store data within <em>Blackboards</em>.</p>
<p><a href="fe5b7602-fcb4-4d39-bf8c-e1742909205a.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Navigation</em>, teaches you how an agent can navigate or find a path through a map or the environment.</p>
<p><a href="1773b819-a79b-4339-ab07-6833fd9bc3a0.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Environment Query System</em>, helps you get to grips with making an <em>Environmental Query</em>, which is a subsystem of the Unreal AI Framework for spatial reasoning. Mastering them is key in implementing believable behaviors within Unreal. </p>
<p><a href="94d71bd8-35a2-481e-adac-1fc3494350ba.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Agent Awareness</em>, deals with how an AI agent can sense the world and the surrounding environment. These include sight, sound, and potentially any sense you might imagine (by extending the system). </p>
<p><a href="e8c4d8a9-579e-4e38-b02a-a9002f1c48ce.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Extending Behavior Trees</em>, takes you through the task of extending behavior trees with Unreal by using Blueprint or C++. You will learn how to program new <em>Tasks</em>, <em>Decorators</em>, and <em>Services</em>.</p>
<p><a href="c1359fa6-3bdf-4f0d-8a0c-98c35f885167.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Crowds</em>, explains how to handle crowds within the Unreal AI Framework that offer some functionality.</p>
<p><a href="6995bf12-0f10-47a9-a48c-cec31696df87.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Designing Behavior Trees – Part</em> <em>I</em>, focuses on how to implement a Behavior Tree so that the AI agent can chase our player in the game (both in Blueprint and C++). This chapter, along with the next two, explores this example from designing to implementation.</p>
<p><a href="063dda79-cb3c-49e7-bfa5-11f8680ee358.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Designing Behavior Trees – Part II</em>, is a continuation of the previous chapter. In particular, we will build the last missing piece of the puzzle (a custom <em>Service</em>) before we build our final <em>Behavior Tree</em> in the next chapter.</p>
<p><a href="039565e6-4f8d-4c73-936f-f5974e9c8226.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Designing Behavior Trees – Part III</em>,<em> </em>is a continuation of the previous chapter and is the final part of <em>Designing Behavior Trees</em>. We will finish what we started. In particular, we will build the final <em>B</em><em>ehavior Tree</em> and make it run.</p>
<p><a href="de51b2fe-fb19-4347-8de9-a31b2c2a6f2f.xhtml"/><a href="de51b2fe-fb19-4347-8de9-a31b2c2a6f2f.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>,<em> Debugging Methods for AI – Logging</em>, examines a series of methods that we can use to debug our AI systems, including console logging, on-screen messages in Blueprint, and many more. By mastering the art of logging, you will be able to easily keep track of your values and which part of the code you are executing.</p>
<p><a href="a60155c1-2bb0-403f-bdcf-dbd6a9c67824.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Debugging Methods for AI – Navigation, EQS, and Profiling</em>, explores a number of more specific tools for the AI systems that are incorporated within Unreal Engine. We will see some more tools for analyzing performance related to AI code, as well as tools to visualize <em>Environmental Queries</em> and the <em>Navigation Mes</em>h.</p>

<p><a href="a8cbf52e-71e1-4f9d-a2bd-913a1e8bd8e1.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, D<em>ebugging Methods for AI – the Gameplay Debugger</em>,<em> </em>gets you to explore the most powerful debugging tool and the best friend of any Unreal AI developer—Gameplay Debugger. This chapter will take you even a step further, by teaching how to extend this tool so to customize it to your needs.</p>
<p><a href="d9a581ce-adca-46fe-8f95-a78b762ebc46.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, G<em>oing Beyond</em>,<em> </em>concludes with some suggestions on how to explore the concepts presented (and others) beyond this book and some thoughts regarding AI.</p>

<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text. Here is an example: "The next event to implement is <kbd>OnBecomRelevant()</kbd>, and it is only fired when the <em>Service </em>becomes relevant"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>void AMyFirstAIController::OnPossess(APawn* InPawn)<br/>{<br/>  Super::OnPossess(InPawn);<br/>  AUnrealAIBookCharacter* Character = Cast&lt;AUnrealAIBookCharacter&gt;(InPawn);<br/>  if (Character != nullptr)<br/>  {<br/>    UBehaviorTree* BehaviorTree = Character-&gt;BehaviorTree;<br/>    if (BehaviorTree != nullptr) {<br/>      RunBehaviorTree(BehaviorTree);<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>void AMyFirstAIController::OnPossess(APawn* InPawn)<br/>{<br/>  Super::OnPossess(InPawn);<br/>  AUnrealAIBookCharacter* Character = Cast&lt;AUnrealAIBookCharacter&gt;(InPawn);<br/>  if (Character != nullptr)<br/>  {<br/><strong>    UBehaviorTree* BehaviorTree = Character-&gt;BehaviorTree;</strong><br/><strong>    if (BehaviorTree != nullptr) {</strong><br/><strong>      RunBehaviorTree(BehaviorTree);</strong><br/><strong>    }</strong><br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select BT_MyFirstBehaviorTree from the drop-down menu within the  Behavior Tree variable."</p>
