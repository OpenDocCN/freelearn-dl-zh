     The captivating aspect of
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      agentic systems
     
    </strong>
    
     lies in the intricate decision-making processes they employ, which provide valuable insights into how choices are optimized within specific contexts.
    
    
     These systems often challenge our conventional understanding of accountability
    
    
     
      and responsibility.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Agentic systems act as the driving force behind innovation and technological advancements in various fields, including robotics, AI, and systems engineering.
    
    
     The development and deployment of these systems have catalyzed the exploration and creation of new forms of automation and intelligent behaviors.
    
    
     Let’s discuss some of the areas where agentic systems are
    
    
     
      making headway:

      : In the field of robotics, agentic systems have paved the way for the design and
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker085">
     </a>
     
      implementation of autonomous robots capable of navigating complex environments, performing intricate tasks, and adapting to changing conditions.
     
     
      These robots, equipped with decision-making capabilities and agency, have found applications in areas such as manufacturing, exploration, search and rescue operations, and healthcare.
     
     
      For instance, robots with agentic behavior can autonomously navigate through disaster zones, assess potential risks, and make decisions to assist in rescue efforts, demonstrating intelligent and
     
     
      
       adaptive behavior.

     <a id="_idIndexMarker086">
     </a>
     
      agents and decision support systems.
     
     
      These systems leverage advanced algorithms, machine learning techniques, and knowledge representation methods to analyze data, reason about complex scenarios, and provide intelligent recommendations or automated decision-making capabilities.
     
     
      Agentic AI systems have been applied in domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and marketing, enabling more efficient and effective

     <a id="_idIndexMarker087">
     </a>
     
      field of systems engineering, agentic systems have facilitated the design and implementation of complex, distributed, and adaptive systems.
     
     
      These systems often consist of multiple interacting components or subsystems, each exhibiting agentic behavior and decision-making capabilities.
     
     
      Such systems are found in areas such as power
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker088">

   <p>
    
     Central to the idea of agentic systems are the concepts of self-governance, agency, and autonomy.
    
    
     Let’s discuss each of these concepts in the subsequent sections to understand what they are and explore the critical role they play within an agentic

     Self-governance
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Agentic systems are artificial and human systems that possess self-governance, adaptability, and interaction.
    
    
     Self-governance refers to the ability of a system or entity to govern
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker089">
    </a>
    
     or control itself autonomously, without external direction or control.
    
    
     In the context of agentic systems, self-governance implies that the system can make its own decisions, set its own goals, and regulate its behavior based on its internal rules, models, and decision-making algorithms.
    
    
     Basically, they operate according to their rules and internal states, and execute a change of behavior, if necessary, due to a change of the environment or the objectives.
    
    
     Such systems interact with the environment or other systems in a way that is meaningful to them and, through these interactions,
    
    
     
      become influenced.

   <p>
    
     Some key
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker090">
    </a>
    
     aspects of self-governance in agentic systems are
    
    
     
      as follows:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Self-organization
      
     </strong>
     
      : The ability to organize and structure its own internal processes, resources, and behavior without

    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Self-regulation

       or constraints
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Self-adaptation

      : The ability to modify its behavior, strategies, or decision-making processes in response to changes in the environment or its own internal conditions, to achieve its goals
     
     
      
       more effectively

     Agency
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Agency is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker092">
    </a>
    
     described as the capability of an individual, or any other entity, to act independently and make choices.
    
    
     In the context of human and artificial systems, agency encompasses the following
    
    
     
      key elements:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Decisional authority
      
     </strong>
     
      : This refers to the power or ability to act and perform actions
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker093">
     </a>
     
      according to a chosen alternative or course of action.
     
     
      Systems with agency possess the autonomy to evaluate different options and select the most appropriate action based on their internal decision-making processes, rather than being solely driven by external forces or
     
     
      
       predetermined rules.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Intentionality
      
     </strong>
     
      : Agency implies the existence of intentions, goals, or objectives that guide the actions and behavior of the system.
     
     
      Agentic systems are not merely reactive; they have a sense of purpose and can pursue specific objectives, adjusting their actions and strategies as necessary to achieve
     
     
      
       those goals.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Responsibility
      
     </strong>
     
      : Agency is closely tied to the concept of responsibility, which is the answerability or accountability for the outcomes and consequences of one’s actions.
     
     
      Systems with agency are considered responsible for their decisions and the impact of their actions on the environment or other entities they
     
     
      
       interact with.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     In most cases, AI agency involves the system’s ability to make decisions autonomously based on its internal programs, models, and the data it processes.
    
    
     These decisions can have a significant impact on the functioning of the system itself or its interactions with
    
    
     
      the environment.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Let’s go back to our travel booking assistant example from the previous chapter, which is responsible
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker094">
    </a>
    
     for booking flight tickets and perhaps even making hotel reservations.
    
    
     In this case, the system would exhibit agency by analyzing various factors, such as the availability of flights between two cities, the price of the tickets, and any other restrictions given by the user such as preferred seat class and so on, and then making decisions on how to optimally look for flights and hotels that meet those criteria so that it minimizes the overall cost of travel for the customer.
    
    
     The system would be responsible for the outcome of its decisions, which would impact the overall travel plan and the cost of travel for
    
    
     
      the customer.

     Autonomy
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Autonomy is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker095">
    </a>
    
     closely related to the concept of agency but focuses more specifically on the degree of independence an entity or system possesses.
    
    
     It can be broken down into
    
    
     
      several aspects:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Operational autonomy
      
     </strong>
     
      : This refers to the ability of a system to perform a specific
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker096">
     </a>
     
      task or set of tasks without direct human intervention or control.
     
     
      A system with operational autonomy can execute its functions independently, relying on its own internal processes, decision-making algorithms, and environmental
     
     
      
       sensing capabilities.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Functional autonomy
      
     </strong>
     
      : This aspect of autonomy involves the system’s ability to make
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker097">
     </a>
     
      choices and take action to achieve set targets or objectives, modulated by the environment or context in which it operates.
     
     
      Functionally autonomous systems can adapt their behavior and decision-making processes in response to changing conditions or stimuli, enabling them to pursue their goals
     
     
      
       more effectively.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Hierarchical autonomy
      
     </strong>
     
      : This aspect relates to the amount of decisional authority
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker098">
     </a>
     
      or decision-making power awarded to a system within a larger framework or organizational structure.
     
     
      Systems with higher hierarchical autonomy have greater latitude in making decisions that impact their subsystems or broader operations, while systems with lower hierarchical autonomy may have more constraints or oversight from
     
     
      
       higher-level entities.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     In AI and robotics, autonomy is a key concept that refers to the extent to which a system can perform tasks and make decisions without the need for continuous
    
    
     
      human intervention.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In our travel
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker099">
    </a>
    
     booking assistant example, the system would have operational autonomy to carry out tasks such as booking flights or hotels, managing reminders, and retrieving travel information with little or no human input.
    
    
     It would also possess functional autonomy, allowing it to interpret user commands, adapt to individual preferences, and make decisions that align with the user’s goals and context.
    
    
     The level of hierarchical autonomy granted to such a system might depend on factors such as user privacy preferences or the system’s access to sensitive data
    
    
     
      and resources.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Note that autonomy in AI and robotic systems does not necessarily imply a complete absence of human oversight or control.
    
    
     Often, these systems operate within well-defined boundaries and constraints set by their designers or operators, while still exhibiting a significant degree of autonomy.
    
    
     In our travel booking example, the chatbot requests additional information, such as travel dates, locations, name, and address, from the user to make flight bookings.
    
    
     It then cross-references this data with available flights, suggesting options that match the user’s preferences.
    
    
     If any detail is missing or unclear, the chatbot prompts the user for clarification, ensuring accuracy while still operating autonomously within the boundaries set by
    
    
     
      its programming.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The concepts of self-governance, agency, and autonomy in AI systems are often accompanied by ethical considerations, particularly regarding the level of autonomy granted to these systems and the potential risks and implications of their decisions.
    
    
     As AI systems become more advanced and capable of independent decision-making, ensuring their alignment with human values and ethical principles
    
    
     
      becomes crucial.

     Here is how the algorithm works, demonstrating the abilities of agency
    
    
     
      and autonomy:
     
    
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     
      We start by naming our agent; we call
     
     
      
       it
      
     
     
      <strong class="source-inline">
       
        TripPlanner
       
      </strong>
     
     
      
       .
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Next, we initialize a new
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       TravelAgent
      
     </strong>
     
      object with the name
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       N = "TripPlanner"
      
     </strong>
     
      ; this represents the creation of an entity capable of both agency
     
     
      
       and autonomy.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      We then set
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker104">
     </a>
     
      up a list to store the goals for the agent.
     
     
      This
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker105">
     </a>
     
      relates to agency, as goals represent the intentions or desired outcomes the agent will work towards on behalf of the user.
     
     
      This is indicated by
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       A.goals ←
      
     </strong>
     
      <strong class="source-inline">
       
        empty list

       .
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Next, we initialize an empty dictionary (also known as a map or key-value pairs) to store the agent’s knowledge.
     
     
      This is crucial for both agency (acting on behalf of users) and autonomy (independent operation), as it will contain information the agent uses to
     
     
      
       make decisions.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>

     </strong>
     
      to the agent’s list of goals.
     
     
      This is akin to the agent taking on objectives on behalf of the user.
     
     
      This is indicated by
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       A.goals.Append(G)
      
     </strong>
     
      .
     
     
      Think of this as the piece of code that will receive the user’s chat message, such as
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       “Book me a flight from San Diego to Seattle.”
      
     </em>
     
      Here, the goal is to book a flight from San Diego
     
     
      
       to Seattle.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>

      and
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       7
      
     </em>
     
      in the algorithm indicate the definition of a function that updates the agent’s knowledge base with a new key-value pair (map or dictionary).
     
     
      This represents agency through the acquisition of information that will be used to act on behalf of the user.
     
     
      It also supports autonomy by providing the agent with information it can use to make independent decisions.
     
     
      This operation is represented as
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       A.knowledge_base[K] ← V
      
     </strong>
     
      .
     
     
      In our case, this function uses several travel-related APIs (in theory) to get flight options between two cities, thus forming the knowledge into a knowledge base.
     
     
      This is also a place where each of these flight options will be scored; for example, late flights get low scores, and early flights get
     
     
      
       higher scores.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Steps
     
     <em class="italic">

      define a function that does a few different things.
     
     
      It takes a list of options and selects the best one based on some scoring criteria.
     
     
      This is an example of autonomy in the algorithm since the agent independently evaluates options and makes a decision without direct
     
     
      
       human intervention.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>

     Python notebook in the
    
    
     
      GitHub repository.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this code snippet, the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      book_travel
     
    </strong>
    
     function takes a departure city code (such as SAN or SEA, which are airport codes) and subsequently calls other functions to set the goal, update its knowledge base, and then make a decision on which flight to choose and book that flight.
    
    
     Note that our agent, although has some functionality of agency and autonomy, is not intelligent.
    
    
     It cannot take plain text messages from a user and decipher what the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker110">
    </a>
    
     user intends to do to set its goals, update its knowledge
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker111">
    </a>
    
     base, and then perform the actions; rather, it needs the airport codes.
    
    
     However, as we saw in our example, a user (or customer) may simply express their intentions in plain language such as “
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Book me a flight from San Diego
     
    </em>
    
     <em class="italic">
      
       to Seattle”
      
     </em>
    
    
     
      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In its current form, given any such user input (message), the agent is incapable of determining what the departure and destination cities are, what the user is asking for, or even what the string of input text even means.
    
    
     This is where generative AI steps in, as we will see in the subsequent chapters.
    
    
     For now, let’s continue with our discussion by looking at the characteristics
    
    
     
      of agents.

     Reviewing intelligent agents and their characteristics
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     An intelligent agent is a complex, self-governed entity that perceives its environment and takes
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker112">
    </a>
    
     action to achieve certain goals or objectives.
    
    
     These agents can range from basic systems that strictly adhere to a predefined set of rules to highly advanced systems with the ability to learn and adapt from
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker113">
    </a>
    
     experience.
    
    
     Intelligent agents are characterized by several
    
    
     
      key attributes:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Reactivity
      
     </strong>
     
      : Reactive agents respond to changes and events occurring in their environment
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker114">
     </a>
     
      in real time.
     
     
      They continuously monitor their surroundings and adjust their behavior accordingly.
     
     
      This reactivity allows agents to adapt to dynamic conditions and respond appropriately to stimuli, ensuring their actions remain relevant
     
     
      
       and effective.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Proactiveness
      
     </strong>
     
      : An ideal intelligent agent should not merely react to events but also
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker115">
     </a>
     
      exhibit proactive behavior.
     
     
      Proactive agents anticipate future needs, challenges, or opportunities, and take the initiative to plan and act accordingly.
     
     
      They are goal-oriented and actively pursue strategies to achieve their objectives, rather than simply reacting to circumstances as
     
     
      
       they arise.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Social ability
      
     </strong>
     
      : Many intelligent agents operate in multi-agent systems, where they
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker116">
     </a>
     
      interact and cooperate with other agents or humans to achieve common goals that require collaborative effort.
     
     
      Social ability encompasses communication, coordination, and negotiation skills, enabling agents to work together effectively and leverage collective intelligence
     
     
      
       or resources.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     With these key characteristics, intelligent agents demonstrate remarkable versatility and efficiency across a wide spectrum of domains and scenarios.
    
    
     Their capabilities enable
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker117">
    </a>
    
     them to excel in tasks ranging from simple, automated
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker118">
    </a>
    
     processes to highly complex, dynamic decision-making situations that demand real-time adaptation and environmental responsiveness.
    
    
     In addition to these core characteristics, intelligent agents may possess other
    
    
     
      advanced capabilities:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Learning and adaptation
      
     </strong>
     
      : Intelligent agents have the ability to learn from experience and adapt their behavior over time.
     
     
      They can acquire new knowledge, refine their decision-making processes, and improve their performance through techniques such as machine learning, reinforcement learning, or
     
     
      
       evolutionary algorithms.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Reasoning and planning
      
     </strong>
     
      : Intelligent agents may employ reasoning and planning capabilities to analyze complex situations, formulate strategies, and make informed decisions.
     
     
      They can leverage techniques such as knowledge representation, logical inference, and planning algorithms to navigate through intricate problem spaces and determine optimal courses
     
     
      
       of action.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Autonomy and self-governance
      
     </strong>
     
      : Intelligent agents often exhibit a degree of autonomy and self-governance, allowing them to make decisions and take actions independently without constant human intervention or supervision.
     
     
      This autonomy enables agents to operate efficiently in dynamic environments or scenarios where continuous human control is impractical
     
     
      
       or impossible.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     With these
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker119">
    </a>
    
     characteristics, intelligent agents can be versatile
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker120">
    </a>
    
     and efficient in a wide range of domains, from simple, automated tasks to highly complex, dynamic decision-making situations.
    
    
     They find applications in areas such as robotics, decision support systems, virtual assistants, gaming, and simulations,
    
    
     
      among others.

     Exploring the architecture of agentic systems
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Agentic systems, designed for executing complex goals in an autonomous way, can be implemented
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker121">
    </a>
    
     using a good variety of architectural patterns.
    
    
     In general, these patterns define the structure and the behavior that allows the system to perceive, reason, learn, and act upon the environment in an effective way.
    
    
     Three main architectural patterns for agentic systems are deliberative, reactive, and hybrid architectures.
    
    
     Let’s discuss them
    
    
     
      in detail.

     architectures, rely
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker123">

     on the use of explicit representations of
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker124">
    </a>
    
     knowledge and reasoning mechanisms to reach decisions.
    
    
     They typically follow a
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      sense-plan-act
     
    </em>
    
     cycle, where they
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker125">
    </a>
    
     first perceive information about the environment, then make a plan of action according to that perception and the knowledge base, and finally execute such plans
    
    
     
      of action.
     
    
   </p>

     The key advantage of deliberative architectures is their ability to handle tasks that involve complex reasoning, such as planning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
    
    
     These architectures leverage techniques such as rule-based reasoning, constraint satisfaction, and heuristic search to navigate through intricate problem spaces and formulate appropriate courses
    
    
     
      of action.

     One of the critical components of a deliberative architecture is the knowledge base that stores symbolic representations of the environment, goals, constraints, and domain-specific knowledge.
    
    
     This knowledge base is typically encoded using formal language or logic, enabling the system to perform logical inference and reasoning.

     Deliberative architectures excel in handling tasks that require complex reasoning, planning, and decision-making in well-defined environments.
    
    
     They can effectively handle
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker128">
    </a>
    
     uncertainty and ambiguity through techniques such as
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker129">

   </p>
   <p>
    
     However, deliberative architectures also have some disadvantages.
    
    
     One significant challenge is the computational cost associated with maintaining and reasoning over complex knowledge bases, which can limit real-time responsiveness in dynamic environments.
    
    
     Additionally, the explicit representation of knowledge can be challenging in domains where knowledge is difficult to formalize or
    
    
     
      constantly evolving.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To address these limitations, deliberative architectures are often combined with reactive or behavior-based components in hybrid architectures, allowing both complex reasoning and rapid response to
    
    
     
      environmental changes.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Despite their limitations, deliberative architectures remain a crucial component in many intelligent systems, particularly in domains where complex decision-making, planning, and reasoning are essential, such as robotics, decision support systems, and intelligent

     <strong class="bold">
      
       Robustness and fault tolerance
      
     </strong>
     
      : These architectures are generally robust and less susceptible to noise or incomplete information.
     
     
      Their simple, standalone nature makes them less prone to catastrophic failures, as individual components or behaviors can compensate for or mitigate the effects of faulty or missing input, especially when used within a
     
     
      
       deliberative architecture.

    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Handling uncertainty
      
     </strong>
     
      : Reactive architectures can effectively handle uncertainty in dynamic environments.
     
     
      Their ability to respond directly to environmental stimuli allows them to adapt and adjust their actions based on the current situation, without relying on precise or complete models of the

      : Reactive architectures generally lack the ability to plan ahead or reason about long-term consequences.
     
     
      Their focus is on immediate responses to environmental stimuli, making it difficult to pursue complex, multi-step goals
     
     
      
       or strategies.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Limited reasoning and abstraction

     Such hybrid architectures typically employ a layered structure, consisting of
    
    
     
      the following:

     The interaction between these two layers is crucial for enabling agentic systems to respond effectively to dynamic environmental contexts while maintaining the capability to plan actions and reason about them.
    
    
     The reactive layer can provide real-time feedback and situational awareness to the deliberative layer, informing its decision-making processes.
    
    
     Conversely, the deliberative layer can guide and influence the reactive layer’s behavior by providing high-level plans, goals,

     Definition and characteristics of MASs
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     A MAS is a system comprising multiple autonomous agents that can interact, collaborate, and
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker154">
    </a>
    
     cooperate to achieve
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker155">
    </a>
    
     shared goals.
    
    
     These agents can be software programs, robots, or even humans equipped with specialized capabilities and goals.
    
    
     Interaction among agents is a necessary component, enabling them to work together efficiently, share information, and divide tasks based on their strengths and areas of expertise.
    
    
     Key characteristics of MASs include
    
    
     
      the following:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Autonomy
      
     </strong>
     
      : Each agent within a MAS is self-governing, making self-contained decisions based on its perception of the environment and its objectives.
     
     
      Agents operate independently without centralized control, exhibiting
     
     
      
       autonomous behavior.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Interaction
      
     </strong>
     
      : Agents in a MAS communicate with each other through defined protocols, enabling them to share information, negotiate tasks, and coordinate their actions.
     
     
      This interaction can take various forms, such as cooperation, coordination, or competition, depending on the nature of the problem and the
     
     
      
       agents’ goals.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Adaptability
      
     </strong>
     
      : MASs possess the flexibility to adapt and change their behavior in response to changes in the environment or changes in the individual agents’ goals.
     
     
      This adaptability makes MAS capable of handling dynamic situations, making them flexible and robust
     
     
      
       during operation.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Distributed control
      
     </strong>
     
      : Unlike centralized systems, MASs employ distributed control, where decision-making and control are distributed among the individual agents.
     
     
      This distributed control contributes to the system’s resilience, as failures or malfunctions in one agent do not necessarily affect the entire
     
     
      
       system’s functionality.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Scalability
      
     </strong>
     
      : MAS architectures are inherently scalable, allowing for the addition or removal of agents as needed.
     
     
      This scalability enables the system to grow or shrink in complexity and capabilities, making it suitable for a wide range
     
     
      
       of applications.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Heterogeneity
      
     </strong>
     
      : Agents within a MAS can be heterogeneous, meaning they can have
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker156">
     </a>
     
      different architectures, capabilities, and goals.
     
     
      This heterogeneity allows the integration of diverse components and the leveraging of specialized expertise, contributing to the overall
     
     
      
       system’s effectiveness.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Decentralized data and knowledge
      
     </strong>
     
      : In a MAS, data and knowledge are decentralized and distributed among the individual agents.
     
     
      This decentralization enhances robustness, as there is no single point of failure, and agents can operate based on their local knowledge
     
     
      
       and perceptions.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     A MAS’s ability to distribute problem-solving capabilities, leverage collective intelligence, exhibit robustness, and integrate heterogeneous components makes them well suited for addressing complex, dynamic problems that are challenging for traditional,
    
    
     
      centralized approaches.

     Interaction
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker157">
    </a>
    
     mechanisms in MASs play a crucial role in enabling effective communication, collaboration, and coordination among the agents within the system.
    
    
     The general classification of the basic interaction mechanisms in a MAS can be presented into three
    
    
     
      main types:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Cooperation
      
     </strong>
     
      : Cooperation can be defined as agents working together towards a common goal or objective.
     
     
      It is particularly important in situations where no single agent, acting alone, can accomplish
     
     
      
       the objective.

   <p class="list-inset">
    
     A prime example of cooperation in MAS is disaster rescue operations, where multiple drones, robotic agents, and humans need to cooperate and collaborate to locate and rescue victims effectively.
    
    
     A MAS relies on agents cooperating by pooling
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker158">
    </a>
    
     their knowledge, resources, and efforts to accomplish tasks that are too complex for one agent.
    
    
     Agents may cooperate by dividing tasks, combining their specialized expertise, or complementing each other’s abilities to tackle complex problems
    
    
     
      more efficiently.
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Coordination
      
     </strong>
     
      : Coordination deals with managing interdependencies that arise from the actions and activities of agents within the system.
     
     
      Coordination is essential when agents share resources and have overlapping responsibilities or
     
     
      
       conflicting actions.

   <p class="list-inset">
    
     Coordination mechanisms in MAS may include strategies such as task scheduling, resource allocation management, and conflict resolution.
    
    
     For example, in
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker159">
    </a>
    
     a manufacturing setting, agents representing different robots on production lines may need to coordinate their actions to ensure efficient use of shared resources, prevent interference, and maintain overall
    
    
     
      production efficiency.
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">
      
       Negotiation
      
     </strong>
     
      : Negotiation is the process through which agents reach agreements on how to share resources, divide tasks, or resolve conflicts.
     
     
      It involves agents making offers, counteroffers, and compromises, even when their interests may
     
     
      
       initially conflict.

     Negotiation mechanisms in MAS enable agents to find mutually beneficial solutions by exchanging proposals, evaluating alternatives, and reaching consensus.
    
    
     This is particularly useful in situations where agents have limited or conflicting resources, different preferences, or competing goals.
    
    
     Negotiation can involve various techniques, such as auctions, voting protocols, bargaining strategies, or game-theoretic approaches, dependin

     These
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker160">
    </a>
    
     interaction mechanisms – cooperation, coordination, and negotiation – are fundamental to the effective functioning of MAS.
    
    
     They enable agents to work together, leverage their collective capabilities, and resolve conflicts or interdependencies that may arise during their interactions.
    
    
     The choice and design of appropriate interaction mechanisms are crucial for enabling efficient and robust multi-agent systems that can tackle complex problems and adapt to
    
    
     
      dynamic environments.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In the context of our travel assistant example, MASs can play a vital role in facilitating efficient coordination and negotiation among various entities involved in the travel industry network.
    
    
     In such a scenario, agents can represent different stakeholders, such as airlines, hotels, car rental companies, tour operators, or travel agencies, and utilize negotiation mechanisms to optimize various aspects of the travel
    
    
     
      booking operations.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     For example, consider a MAS where agents represent airlines, hotels, and other relevant parties involved in the travel industry.
    
    
     These agents can engage in negotiation processes to determine
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker161">
    </a>
    
     flight schedules, room availability, pricing, and other travel-related decisions, aiming to achieve the highest efficiency for the overall travel
    
    
     
      booking operations.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The negotiation process can unfold
    
    
     
      as follows:
     
    
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     
      Agents representing airlines can propose available seats, flight schedules, and pricing for
     
     
      
       their routes.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Agents representing hotels can evaluate these proposals based on their room availability, expected occupancy rates, and demand forecasts, and negotiate with the airline agents for the most suitable flight schedules that align with their check-in and
     
     
      
       check-out times.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Travel agency agents can then negotiate with both airline and hotel agents, taking into account customer preferences, budget constraints, and their specific requirements for travel dates
     
     
      
       and accommodations.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Transportation agents (for example, car rental companies or shuttle services) can also participate in the negotiation process, offering ground transportation services and proposing pickup/drop-off schedules and associated costs to the other
     
     
      
       agents involved.
      
     
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    
     Throughout the negotiation process, agents can utilize various strategies and algorithms to evaluate proposals, generate counteroffers, and find mutually acceptable agreements.
    
    
     These strategies may involve techniques such as auctions, bargaining protocols, game-theoretic approaches, or optimization algorithms tailored for travel industry operations.
    
    
     For example, agents may employ multi-attribute utility functions that consider factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, and customer preferences to evaluate and rank various proposals.
    
    
     They can then engage in iterative negotiations, adjusting their offers and counter offers based on their respective utility functions
    
    
     
      and constraints.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Moreover, the distributed nature of MAS allows decentralized decision-making, where each agent can make decisions based on its local knowledge and constraints, while still collaborating and coordinating with other agents to achieve global optimization goals.
    
    
     The negotiation mechanisms in MAS for our travel and hospitality example not only facilitate efficient coordination among various entities but also provide the flexibility and adaptability to handle dynamic changes in demand, supply, pricing changes, or other operational factors, ultimately leading to a more resilient and responsive system that caters to
    
    
     
      customer demands.

      this algorithm:
     
    
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     
      The first step is to clearly define a set of agents: in this case a flight agent, a hotel agent, and a travel agency agent.
     
     
      The flight and hotel agents are responsible for airlines and hotel-related actions, and the travel agency agent is responsible for creating travel packages based on the best
     
     
      
       options available.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Steps
     
     <em class="italic">

      through
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       8
      
     </em>
     
      show how the travel agent interacts with multiple airline and hotel
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker165">
     </a>
     
      agents to compile travel packages.
     
     
      It finds appropriate flight schedules and hotel availability in the destination city and subsequently uses that data to
     
     
      
       create packages.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Steps
     
     <em class="italic">

      through
     
     <em class="italic">

      demonstrate the coordination between the selected airline and hotel agents to confirm the flight and hotel booking according to the
     
     
      
       chosen package.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Steps
     
     <em class="italic">

     <em class="italic">

     </em>
     
      show how each airline and hotel agent independently updates
     
     
      
       its pricing.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      The main loop from steps
     
     <em class="italic">

     </em>
     
      through
     
     <em class="italic">
      
       33
      
     </em>
     
      ties everything together, showing how the system handles travel requests and periodically updates pricing across
     
     
      
       all agents.
      
     
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    
     This example algorithm demonstrates a combination of coordination and cooperation
    
    
     
      between agents:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      Cooperation, since all the agents work towards a common goal of booking the travel itinerary for
     
     
      
       the user
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Coordination, since the travel agency agent needs input from both the flight agent and the hotel agent to build a travel package, and then subsequently book the best
     
     
      
       travel package
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>

     Summary
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we explored the intriguing world of agentic systems and intelligent agents, delving into the core concepts of agency, autonomy, and the characteristics that define an ideal agent.
    
    
     We studied various architectural patterns for designing and implementing such systems, including deliberative, reactive, and hybrid approaches.
    
    
     Additionally, we examined MASs, where multiple agents collaborate and coordinate to achieve collective goals through mechanisms such as cooperation, coordination,
    
    
     
      and negotiation.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The knowledge gained from this chapter provides a solid foundation for developing intelligent and autonomous systems capable of operating effectively in complex, unpredictable environments.
    
    
     You should now be able to decide which agentic system architecture best suits any particular use case, and be able to craft a mental model of a MAS that gives you the foundation of your agentic system.
    
    
     In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the essentials of an a
    
    <a id="_idTextAnchor060">

     gentic system, further strengthening our ability to build
    
    
     
      efficient systems.

      Key characteristics of intelligent agents include reactivity, proactiveness, social ability, autonomy, and the capability to learn
     
     
      
       and adapt.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      The main architectural patterns for intelligent agents are deliberative (knowledge-based), reactive (behavior-based), and
     
     
      
       hybrid architectures.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Deliberative architectures excel in complex reasoning and planning but may struggle with real-time responsiveness in dynamic environments.
     
     
      Reactive architectures are well suited for dynamic environments requiring rapid responses but lack long-term planning and abstract
     
     
      
       reasoning capabilities.

      Key characteristics include autonomy, interaction, adaptability, distributed control, scalability, heterogeneity, and decentralized data
     
     
      
       and knowledge.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      The main interaction mechanisms in MASs are cooperation (working towards a common goal), coordination (managing interdependencies), and negotiation (
     
     
      
       reaching agreements).
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      MASs find applications in domains such as supply chain management, traffic control, robotics, environmental monitoring, distributed sensor networks, and intelligent
