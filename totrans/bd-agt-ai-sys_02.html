     Summary
    </span>
   </h1>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">
     In this chapter, we explored the intriguing world of agentic systems and intelligent agents, delving into the core concepts of agency, autonomy, and the characteristics that define an ideal agent.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.2">
     We studied various architectural patterns for designing and implementing such systems, including deliberative, reactive, and hybrid approaches.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.3">
     Additionally, we examined MASs, where multiple agents collaborate and coordinate to achieve collective goals through mechanisms such as cooperation, coordination,
    </span>
    <span class="No-Break">
     <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">
      and negotiation.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">
     The knowledge gained from this chapter provides a solid foundation for developing intelligent and autonomous systems capable of operating effectively in complex, unpredictable environments.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.2">
     You should now be able to decide which agentic system architecture best suits any particular use case, and be able to craft a mental model of a MAS that gives you the foundation of your agentic system.
