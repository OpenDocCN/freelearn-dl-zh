    hallucinations. A broader idea, sometimes referred to as K-LLMs, can utilize multiple
    LLMs to answer a question or create a complex solution. One such scheme, as discussed
    previously, could be where each of the models checks each other’s answers to validate
    responses. A possible other approach is where they are assigned roles where each
    has its particular specialty (for example, product manager, designer, frontend
    engineer, backend engineer, and QA engineer) and they iterate over the solution,
    forming a team of experts. This can also allow for smaller and specialized LLMs,
    which are thus cheaper to train, quicker to process, and smaller in computation

    of proprietary data ownership within our current AI-driven business paradigm.
    On one hand, foundation models are democratizing AI, significantly lowering the
    barrier to entry for companies that lack extensive proprietary datasets. These
    models offer performance that appears just as robust as if they were trained on
    specialized, proprietary data. This trend could suggest that the value of owning

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the realm of healthcare, the application of ML extends beyond mere predictive
    analytics to fostering insights that can fundamentally alter patient care and
    outcomes. This domain’s complexity is underscored by the challenge of capturing
    the nuanced social determinants of health—variables such as living conditions,
    food security, and access to transportation—that significantly influence health
    outcomes. However, the current landscape of data collection and model training
    often overlooks these critical, yet less quantifiable aspects of patient life,
    leading to a gap in the personalized application of ML predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A predominant issue arises from the reliance on surrogates or proxies in datasets
    that fail to encapsulate the individual’s complexity fully. This reliance can
    obscure the subtleties inherent to each patient, thereby diluting the potential
    for ML to effect meaningful change in healthcare settings. The disparity between
    what the data models are trained on and the real-world contexts they are applied
    to further complicates this issue. For instance, LLMs trained on generic text
    data lack the contextual richness necessary for nuanced applications, such as
    tailoring healthcare recommendations to individual social circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This disconnect not only hampers the model’s utility in providing relevant insights
    but also introduces unintended biases. These biases emerge when models, devoid
    of context or unaware of their training data’s limitations, misapply generalized
    predictions to individual cases. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted
    effort toward enriching data collection processes to capture a more comprehensive
    view of patient social determinants and ensuring models can interpret and apply
    this information effectively.
  prefs: []

    specific sources of unfairness, emphasizing the critical role of contextually
    rich and adequately sized training samples to improve both fairness and accuracy.

    evaluation of model outputs and impacts, ensuring they do not perpetuate existing
    biases or introduce new ones. Collaborative industry efforts toward algorithmic
    vigilance, ethical use of sensitive data, and incorporating diverse perspectives
    in model development processes are also vital. By prioritizing fairness as a fundamental
    aspect of model accuracy and utility, we can leverage ML to deliver more just
    and equitable outcomes across sectors.
  prefs: []

    datasets as outlined previously, it’s crucial to acknowledge the foundational
    challenges faced by ML in healthcare. These challenges include the need for a
    deeper understanding of patient social determinants and the imperative to bridge
    the gap between what the data models are trained on and the contexts in which
    they are deployed. Addressing these issues is a prerequisite for leveraging ML
    to its fullest potential in improving healthcare outcomes and ensuring that innovations

    there are several different models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses
    (for example, one is fast but doesn’t generate quality insights; the other is
    slow but is very precise), and the “right” model is to be chosen on a per-input
    basis by a decision process that is optimized to suit given constraints. For instance,
    a prompt that requires a binary *Yes/No* inference on a given small set of sentences
    may be channeled to a simple LLM while a prompt that requires applying legal judgment

    By employing industry-accepted statistical methods aligned with privacy laws and
    regulations, data is rendered anonymous, ensuring that individual privacy is preserved
    while retaining the data’s value for research and development. Techniques such
    as hashing, uniform date-shifting, and tokenization are utilized to obfuscate
    data, facilitating its use in federated learning without compromising patient
    privacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, the secure-by-design philosophy underpinning Connect ensures that
    data and **intellectual property** (**IP**) remain under the control of their
    respective owners, accessible only as authorized. This approach not only protects
    privacy but also fosters innovation by allowing Mayo Clinic Platform customers
    to develop, train, and validate algorithms on de-identified data cohorts. Rigorous
    controls, including code repository reviews, strict access management, and prohibitions
    on data imports and exports, further reinforce the platform’s commitment to privacy
    and security.

    the **General Data Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**) in the European Union, the
    **General Data Protection Law** (**LGPD**) in Brazil, or China’s security and
    privacy rules, the model ensures compliance while enabling global collaboration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, the “Data Behind Glass” model presents a viable pathway for the
    NLP community to achieve the dual objectives of fostering open research and safeguarding
    privacy. By de-identifying, securing, and federating data, Mayo Clinic Platform
    democratizes its use without compromising patient privacy, setting a precedent
    for responsible data handling in an era where the balance between transparency

    approaches such as **Structured State Space Models** (**SSMs** or **S4**). Similarly,
    **mixture of experts** (**MoEs**), while not new, are recently proving their incredible
    power to deliver smaller models that are very efficient, such as Mixtral by Mistral
