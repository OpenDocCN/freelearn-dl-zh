- en: This book combines **User Experience** (**UX**) expertise with ChatGPT and related
    **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) to create enterprise-grade applications that
    can solve real business problems. This is done in a way that almost all of the
    learnings of the books will continue to apply to the latest LLMs as they evolve
    and improve. We focus on the integration of LLMs with business solutions. This
    includes creating customer chatbots for customer service, creating recommender
    solutions to offer suggestions for sales and service, making purchase choices,
    solving other business problems in any vertical, or helping create more effective
    behind-the-scenes solutions that contain little or no UX. We take the science
    and art of UI design and research methods, techniques, and recommendations to
    make LLM solutions functional, usable, necessary, and engaging. Tips and expert
    secrets on applying UX to every stage of the design of LLM solutions at scale
    are shared. Almost none of this material is on the Internet or shared at vendor
    sites, so it is a unique resource for the design and design adjacent community.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book would appeal to individuals interested in enhancing their knowledge
    and skills in UI/UX design and looking for a comprehensive guide incorporating
    the latest technologies to apply UX principles to create enterprise-grade ChatGPT-powered
    solutions. It is suitable for seasoned designers looking to expand their knowledge,
    as well as writers, linguists, product managers, and design-savvy engineers who
    need to know UI/UX design fundamentals as they apply to ChatGPT.

- en: The book follows a design-centered approach to producing ChatGPT-based solutions
    to solve business or “enterprise” problems. It helps decide and prioritize customer
    use cases for generative AI, accelerates the value from an LLM, extends the platform
    to serve customer needs, and explains monitoring and improving the quality of
    that service. Learning these skills will give you conversational AI design superpowers.
    An enterprise or business-class ChatGPT-powered solution should focus on providing
    customers with a unique skill, something more intelligent and focused than they
    can get from generic generative AI. To imagine and create world-class LLM-powered
    solutions, this book is for you.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B21964_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), *Recognizing the Power of
    Design in ChatGPT*, begins with a brief introduction to the relationship between
    design and LLMs, including the art and science of UX and the history of LLMs.
    The various design frameworks for deploying an LLM are discussed, including a
    chat UI, a hybrid UI that includes chat with graphical user interfaces, recommender
    UIs that are not interactive, and designs intended to work behind the scenes with
    backend solutions. There is a small hands-on lab for building a simple model using
    a no-code playground.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B21964_02_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031), *Conducting Effective
    User Research*, provides many tips and tricks for using some of the most critical
    user research tools to evaluate adding ChatGPT and LLMs to enterprise solutions.
    We cover methods such as surveys, needs analysis, interviews, and digging into
    data to create a conversational analysis.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B21964_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Identifying Optimal Use Cases
    for ChatGPT*, teaches how to identify the breadth of solutions to which an LLM
    can add value and explains when an LLM is not suited for a use case. We briefly
    cover classic use case design and then spend time aligning an LLM’s capabilities
    with user goals. We ensure you know ChatGPT’s limitations and biases and how to
    handle inappropriate responses.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B21964_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085), *Scoring Stories*, helps you
    become an expert in prioritizing user stories. This chapter is also valuable after
    a product or service goes to customers. You learn to prioritize updates, patches,
    and bug fixes so the customer gets the most value from the team’s efforts. You
    will be able to balance customer priorities with the cost of development and make
    rational decisions to help plan and deliver the most value for the least cost.
    It explains in simple terms how to apply some special Agile tools to prioritize
    all this work. No road is without some bumps, but we share some complexities so
    you can navigate this successfully with the entire team.'

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B21964_05_split_000.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108), *Defining the Desired
    Experience*, is the final chapter before we get serious about the inner workings
    of ChatGPT. You will uncover specific considerations, design issues, and solutions
    for the full range of contexts of use. These include chat experiences, hybrid
    UIs (a graphical user interface merged with chat intelligence), recommendation
    UIs, and backend solutions (those without a customer-facing UI). We will address
    overarching considerations for these desired experiences, ensuring you know how
    to handle accessibility and internationalization while creating trust and handling
    security in any of these solutions.'

    – Content Is King*, dives into the complex nature of enterprise data, which is
    fundamental to creating a ChatGPT solution based on customers’ needs. Explore
    how data sources such as knowledge bases, databases, spreadsheets, and other systems
    provide a source of truth. This helps connect customers to actions and explains
    how product people like yourself can contribute at this stage. Hands-on activities
    and a case study on annotating and cleaning data help explain the key points.
    We will cover retrieval augmented generation to help bridge the gap between an
    enterprise’s vast data sources and the LLM.'

    you on creating instructions that control, adapt, and personify the communications
    from the LLM to the customer. You will learn the difference between prompts anyone
    can give to an LLM and the more refined nature of instructional prompts for enterprise
    solutions.'

    to interpret ChatGPT style, tone, and voice. Essential guidelines and heuristics
    adapted and applied to evaluating ChatGPT solutions are reviewed so you can learn
    how to use design thinking to create clarity in the output from your LLM solutions.
    Dozens of examples are provided, along with a case study and example prompts that

    Our approach is one of care and feeding, following the life cycle of learning
    from the product’s users and feeding back any learnings to have it grow and mature.

    We expect everyone to use some form of LLM for personal use. We would like some
    basic familiarity with UI terms and techniques, even if you are not an expert
    or a UI professional. We talk about creating surveys, carrying out customer interviews,
    and giving lots of tips and tricks, but assume a basic understanding of these
    techniques. References are provided to get you up to speed in places where a knowledge
    roadblock might appear.

    experience. We dabble in a few other free resources and LLMs. You will need an
    account to access our GitHub files and ChatGPT. If you code or are more technical,
    explore some of the more advanced topics and links provided. Although the book
    and tutorials are focused on ChatGPT, the learnings in the book can apply to any
    LLM.

    directly into ChatGPT. However, no programming or code examples are needed, so
    missing a comma, for instance, will not impact your ability to learn and follow
    along. We provide files with sample data; you can use those without issue and
    test and experiment with the latest LLMs.
