    which is free and easy to setup just by providing your email ID, or an **AWS Identity
    Center** login. For chapters that leverage Amazon Q Developer with other AWS services
    including Amazon SageMaker Studio, Amazon EMR Studio, Amazon Glue Studio, Amazon
    Redshift and AWS Lambda, you will need an **AWS account**. Many features of Amazon
    Q Developer are available for use in the **Free** tier, whereas certain features
    are available only in the **Pro** tier. Even though in this book we have highlighted
    features available only in **Pro** tier, it is advisable to always refer to the
    Amazon Q Developer pricing document for latest updates, the link to which is provided
    at the end of [*Chapter 2*](B21378_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022). Setup needed for
    multiple IDEs, command line, and also with various AWS services is also covered
