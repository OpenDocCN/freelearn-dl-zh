<p>The maze navigation problem is a classic computer science problem that is closely related to creating autonomous navigation agents that can find a path through ambiguous environments. The maze environment is an illustrative domain for the class of problems that have a deceptive fitness landscape. This means that the goal-oriented fitness function can have steep gradients of fitness scores in <span>dead ends in </span>the maze that are close to the final goal point. Such areas of the maze become the local optima for objective-based search algorithms that may converge in these areas. When the search algorithm converges in such deceptive local optima, it cannot find an adequate maze-solver agent.</p>
<p>In the following example, you can see a two-dimensional maze with local optima dead ends, which are shaded in:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765 image-border" src="assets/fd56ef1f-ea8c-4f17-8d58-62c569a8352f.png" style="width:19.25em;height:19.25em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="s1">The two-dimensional maze configuration</span></div>
<p>The maze configuration in the diagram visualizes the landscape of the deceptive fitness scores concentrated in the local optima dead ends (marked as filled segments). The maze-solver agent navigating from the starting point (bottom circle) to the exit point (top circle) using the objective-based search algorithm will be prone to getting stuck in the local optima dead ends. Also, a deceptive fitness score landscape such as this can prevent the objective-based search algorithm from finding a successful maze solver.</p>
<p>The agent navigating through the maze is a robot equipped with a set of sensors, allowing it to detect nearby obstacles and get the direction to the maze exit. The motion of the robot is controlled by two actuators, which affect the linear and angular movement of the robot body. The actuators of the robot are controlled by an ANN, which receives input from the sensors and produces the two control signals for the actuators.</p>

<p>The environment for the maze simulation consists of three major components that are implemented as separate Python classes:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><kbd>Agent</kbd><span class="s1">: The class that holds information related to the maze navigator agent that is used by simulation (see the <kbd>agent.py</kbd><em> </em><span>file</span> for the <span>implementation </span>details).</span></li>
<li class="li1"><kbd>AgentRecordStore</kbd><span class="s1">: The class that manages the storage of records relating to evaluations of all the solver agents during the evolutionary process. The collected records can be used to analyze the evolutionary process after its completion (see the <kbd>agent.py</kbd> file for the <span>implementation </span>details).</span></li>
<li class="li1"><kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd><span class="s1">: The class that contains information about the maze simulation environment. This class also provides methods that manage the simulation environment, control the position of a solver agent, perform collision detection, and generate the input data for sensors of the agent (see the <kbd>maze_environment.py</kbd> <span>file </span>for the <span>implementation </span>details).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we will look at each part of the maze simulation environment in more detail.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we consider a two-dimensional maze navigation task. This task is easy to visualize, and it is relatively easy to write the simulator of the maze-navigating robot for a two-dimensional maze. The main goal of the robot is to navigate through a maze to the defined goal point in a specified number of time steps. The ANN that controls the robot is a product of the neuroevolution process.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The neuroevolution algorithm starts with a very basic initial ANN configuration that only has input nodes for sensors and output nodes for actuators, which gradually becomes more complex until a successful maze solver is found. This task is complicated by a peculiar configuration of the maze that has several <em>cul-de-sacs</em>, which prevent finding the route to the goal by creating local optima in the fitness landscape, as discussed previously.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the schematic drawing of the maze agent used in the maze-solving simulation:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-766 image-border" src="assets/6d5ee7a0-e182-4b03-9e75-4d8dab75b2f9.png" style="width:17.75em;height:17.67em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="s1">The maze agent (robot) schema</span></div>
<p>In the preceding diagram, the filled circle defines the rigid body of the robot. The arrow within the filled circle shows the heading of the robot. The six arrows around the filled circle represent <strong>six rangefinder sensors</strong> that indicate the distance to the nearest obstacle in a given direction. The four outer circle segments denote the <strong>four pie-slice radar sensors</strong> that act as a compass toward the goal point (maze exit).</p>
<p class="mce-root">The specific radar sensor becomes activated when the line from the goal point to the center of the robot falls within its <strong>field of view</strong> (<strong>FOV</strong>). The detection range of the radar sensor is limited by the area of the maze that falls into its FOV. Thus, at any given time, one of the four radar sensors is activated, indicating the maze exit direction.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The radar sensors have the following FOV zones relative to the robot's heading:</span></p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">

<tr>

<td>225.0 ~ 315.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>The rangefinder sensor is a trace ray drawn from the center of the robot in a specific direction. It becomes activated when intersecting with any obstacle and returns a distance to the detected obstacle. The detection range of this sensor is defined by a particular configuration parameter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rangefinder sensors of the robot monitor the following directions relative to the agent heading:</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The movement of the robot is controlled by two actuators that apply forces that turn and/or propel the agent frame, that is, change its linear and/or angular velocity.</p>
<p>The Python implementation of the maze-solver agent has multiple fields to hold its current state and to maintain the activation states of its sensors:</p>
<pre>    def __init__(self, location, heading=0, speed=0, <br/>                 angular_vel=0, radius=8.0, range_finder_range=100.0):<br/>        self.heading = heading<br/>        self.speed = speed<br/>        self.angular_vel = angular_vel<br/>        self.radius = radius<br/>        self.range_finder_range = range_finder_range<br/>        self.location = location<br/>        # defining the range finder sensors<br/>        self.range_finder_angles = [-90.0, -45.0, 0.0, 45.0, 90.0, -180.0]<br/>        # defining the radar sensors<br/>        self.radar_angles = [(315.0, 405.0), (45.0, 135.0),<br/>                             (135.0, 225.0), (225.0, 315.0)]<br/>        # the list to hold range finders activations<br/>        self.range_finders = [None] * len(self.range_finder_angles)<br/>        # the list to hold pie-slice radar activations<br/>        self.radar = [None] * len(self.radar_angles)</pre>

<p>To simulate <span>the solver agent </span><span>navigating the</span><span> </span><span>maze, we need to define an environment that manages the configuration of the maze, tracks the position of the maze-solving agent, and provides inputs to the sensor data arrays of the navigating robot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these features fit into one logical block that is encapsulated into the <kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd> Python class, which has the following fields (as can be seen from the class constructor):</span></p>
<pre>    def __init__(self, agent, walls, exit_point, exit_range=5.0):<br/>        self.walls = walls<br/>        self.exit_point = exit_point<br/>        self.exit_range = exit_range<br/>        # The maze navigating agent<br/>        self.agent = agent<br/>        # The flag to indicate if exit was found<br/>        self.exit_found = False<br/>        # The initial distance of agent from exit<br/>        self.initial_distance = self.agent_distance_to_exit()</pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding code shows the default constructor of the <kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd> class with initialization of all its fields:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">The maze configuration is determined by a list of walls and <kbd>exit_point</kbd>. Walls are lists of line segments; each line segment represents a specific wall in the maze, and <kbd>exit_point</kbd> is the location of maze's exit.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">The <kbd>exit_range</kbd> field stores value of the range distance around the <kbd>exit_point</kbd> that defines the exit area. We consider that the agent has successfully solved a maze when its position is in the exit area.</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maze-solver agent is controlled by an ANN that needs to receive sensor data as input to produce the corresponding control signals as output. As we have already mentioned, the navigator </span><span>agent</span><span> </span><span>is equipped with an array of two types of sensors:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Six <em>rangefinder sensors</em> for the detection of collisions with the maze walls, which indicate the distance to the closest obstacle in a particular direction.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Four <em>pie-slice radar sensors</em>, which indicate the direction to the maze's exit point from any place in the maze.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sensor values need to be updated at each simulation step, and the <kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd> class provides two designated methods that update both types of sensor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The array of rangefinder sensors is updated as follows (see the <kbd>update_rangefinder_sensors</kbd> function):</span></p>
<pre>        for i, angle in enumerate(self.agent.range_finder_angles):<br/>            rad = geometry.deg_to_rad(angle)<br/>            projection_point = geometry.Point(<br/>                x = self.agent.location.x + math.cos(rad) * \<br/>                    self.agent.range_finder_range,<br/>                y = self.agent.location.y + math.sin(rad) * \<br/>                    self.agent.range_finder_range<br/>            )<br/>            projection_point.rotate(self.agent.heading, <br/>                                    self.agent.location)<br/>            projection_line = geometry.Line(a = self.agent.location, <br/>                                            b = projection_point)<br/>            min_range = self.agent.range_finder_range<br/>            for wall in self.walls:<br/>                found, intersection = wall.intersection(projection_line)<br/>                if found:<br/>                    found_range = intersection.distance(<br/>                                                   self.agent.location)<br/>                    if found_range &lt; min_range:<br/>                        min_range = found_range<br/>            # Store the distance to the closest obstacle<br/>            self.agent.range_finders[i] = min_range</pre>
<p>This code enumerates all detection directions of the rangefinder sensors, which are determined by the direction angles (see the <kbd>range_finder_angles</kbd> field initialization in the <kbd>Agent</kbd> constructor). For each direction, a projection line is then created, starting from the current position of the agent and with a length equal to the rangefinder's detection range. After that, the projection line is tested to see if it intersects any of the maze walls. If multiple intersections are detected, the distance to the closest wall is stored as a value to a specific rangefinder sensor. Otherwise, the maximal detection range will be saved as a value for a rangefinder sensor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The array of pie-slice radar sensors needs to be updated with the following code in the <kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd> class:</span></p>
<pre>    def update_radars(self):<br/>        target = geometry.Point(self.exit_point.x, self.exit_point.y)<br/>        target.rotate(self.agent.heading, self.agent.location)<br/>        target.x -= self.agent.location.x<br/>        target.y -= self.agent.location.y<br/>        angle = target.angle()<br/>        for i, r_angles in enumerate(self.agent.radar_angles):<br/>            self.agent.radar[i] = 0.0 # reset specific radar <br/>            if (angle &gt;= r_angles[0] and angle &lt; r_angles[1]) or <br/>               (angle + 360 &gt;= r_angles[0] and angle + 360 &lt; r_angles[1]):<br/>                # fire the radar<br/>                self.agent.radar[i] = 1.0</pre>
<p>The preceding code creates a copy of the maze exit point and rotates it with respect to the agent's heading and position within the global coordinate system. The target point is then translated to align it with the local coordinate system of the maze-solver agent; the agent is placed at the origin of the coordinates. After that, we calculate the angle of the vector drawn from the origin of the coordinates to the target point within the local coordinate system of the agent. This angle is an azimuth to the maze exit point from the current agent position. When the azimuth angle is found, we enumerate over the registered pie-sliced radar sensors to find the one that includes the azimuth angle in its FOV. The corresponding radar sensor is activated by setting its value to 1, while other radar sensors are deactivated by zeroing their values.</p>

<p>The position of the maze-solver agent within a maze needs to be updated in each simulation step after receiving the corresponding control signals from the controller ANN. The following code is executed to update the position of the maze-solver agent:</p>
<pre>    def update(self, control_signals):<br/>        if self.exit_found:<br/>            return True # Maze exit already found<br/>        self.apply_control_signals(control_signals)<br/>        vx = math.cos(geometry.deg_to_rad(self.agent.heading)) * \<br/>                      self.agent.speed<br/>        vy = math.sin(geometry.deg_to_rad(self.agent.heading)) * \<br/>                      self.agent.speed<br/>        self.agent.heading += self.agent.angular_vel<br/>        if self.agent.heading &gt; 360:<br/>            self.agent.heading -= 360<br/>        elif self.agent.heading &lt; 0:<br/>            self.agent.heading += 360<br/>        new_loc = geometry.Point(<br/>            x = self.agent.location.x + vx, <br/>            y = self.agent.location.y + vy<br/>        )<br/>        if not self.test_wall_collision(new_loc):<br/>            self.agent.location = new_loc<br/>        self.update_rangefinder_sensors()<br/>        self.update_radars()<br/>        distance = self.agent_distance_to_exit()<br/>        self.exit_found = (distance &lt; self.exit_range)<br/>        return self.exit_found</pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <kbd>update(self, control_signals)</kbd> <span>function </span>is defined in the <kbd>MazeEnvironment</kbd> class and is invoked in each simulation time step. It receives a list with control signals as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the maze-solver agent has reached the exit area after its position <span>update</span>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The code at the beginning of this function applies received control signals to the current values of the agent's angular and linear velocities as follows (see the <kbd>apply_control_signals(self, control_signals)</kbd> function):</span></p>
<pre>       self.agent.angular_vel += (control_signals[0] - 0.5)<br/>       self.agent.speed += (control_signals[1] - 0.5)</pre>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, the following function tests whether the agent has reached the maze exit, which is defined by the circular area around the exit point with a radius equal to the value of the <kbd>exit_range</kbd> field:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After completing the experiment, we are interested in evaluating and visualizing how each individual solver agent performed during the evolutionary process through all generations.

<li class="li2"><span class="s2"><kbd>species_id</kbd> and <kbd>species_age</kbd> are the ID and age of the species the agent belongs to.</span></li>

<p>After all agents' evaluation records are collected during the neuroevolutionary process, we are interested in visualizing the recorded data to get insights into performance. The visualization should include the final positions of all solver agents and allow to set the threshold value for the <span>fitness </span>of the species to control what species will be added to the corresponding plot. We decided to present the collected agent records in two plots drawn one above the other. The top plot is for the agent records that belong to the species with a fitness score greater than or equal to the specified fitness threshold, and the bottom plot is for the rest of the records.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The visualization of the agent records is implemented in the new methods in the <kbd>visualize.py</kbd> script. You should already be familiar with this script from the previous experiments described in this book.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Objective function definition using the fitness score</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this section, you will learn about the creation of successful maze-solver agents using a goal-oriented objective function to guide the evolutionary process. This objective function is based on the estimation of the fitness score of the maze solver by measuring the distance between its final position and the maze exit after executing the 400 simulation steps. Thus, the objective function is goal-oriented and solely depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment: reaching the maze exit area.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will consider a different approach for solution search optimization, which is based on the <strong>Novelty Search</strong> (<strong>NS</strong>) optimization method. The NS optimization method is built around exploring new configurations of the solver agent during evolution and doesn't include proximity to the final goal (in this case, the maze exit) in the objective function definition. We will demonstrate that the NS approach can outperform the conventional goal-oriented objective function definition that we consider in this chapter.</p>
<p>The goal-oriented objective function used in this experiment is determined as follows. First, we need to define the loss function as the <em>Euclidean distance</em> between the final position of the agent at the end of the simulation and the <span>position of the </span>maze exit:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/c15d4c04-be73-46a0-8646-389753f2063f.png" style="width:10.50em;height:4.08em;"/></p>
<p><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/6cf451c8-aadb-4687-83ce-03c2010b1639.png" style="width:0.67em;height:0.92em;"/> is a loss function, <img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/81e08623-15b0-4415-ab2b-5ce0ca539338.png" style="width:0.75em;height:0.83em;"/> is the coordinates of the final position of the agent, and <img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/79fa5d4c-f267-4202-b143-38f359cf7e81.png" style="width:0.42em;height:0.92em;"/> is the coordinates of the maze exit. In this experiment, we considered a two-dimensional maze configuration, so the coordinates have two values, one for each dimension.</p>
<p>With the loss function defined previously, we now can specify the fitness function:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/ce2af4c9-1d4c-44b0-8e44-7283a2ee9c1e.png" style="width:11.75em;height:2.67em;"/></p>
<p><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/77443d18-44e5-4825-ad13-e2e97b4fbea7.png" style="width:2.33em;height:1.08em;"/> is the radius of the exit area around the maze exit point and <img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/7eee273d-055d-4d6b-a6dd-e728f8d893bb.png" style="width:1.25em;height:1.00em;"/> is the normalized fitness score. The normalized fitness score is given as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/e0806012-1153-441c-9cca-ecc9e2d334ea.png" style="width:6.92em;height:2.42em;"/></p>
<p><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/412eae6e-5bcb-478b-abed-32e75ca636c1.png" style="width:2.33em;height:1.08em;"/> is the initial distance from the solver agent to the maze exit at the start of the navigation simulation.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The equation normalizes the fitness score to be in the range <kbd>(0,1]</kbd>, but can result in negative values in rare cases when the final position of the agent is far away from its initial position and the maze exit. The following amendments to the normalized fitness score will be applied to avoid negative values:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/2a5fb3c0-5f4a-4ad0-8a6a-b8e87b8c6f69.png" style="width:11.58em;height:2.58em;"/></p>
<p>When the fitness score is less than or equal to <kbd>0.01</kbd>, it will be assigned the minimal fitness score value (<kbd>0.01</kbd>) supported; otherwise, it will be used as is. We selected the minimal fitness score to be higher than zero to give every genome the chance to reproduce.</p>
<p>The following code in Python implements the goal-oriented objective function:</p>
<pre>    # Calculate the fitness score based on distance from exit<br/>    fitness = env.agent_distance_to_exit()<br/>    if fitness &lt;= self.exit_range:<br/>         fitness = 1.0<br/>    else:<br/>        # Normalize fitness score to range (0,1]<br/>        fitness = (env.initial_distance - fitness) / \<br/>                   env.initial_distance<br/>        if fitness &lt;= 0.01:<br/>            fitness = 0.01</pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The code first invokes the <kbd>agent_distance_to_exit()</kbd> <span>function, which </span>calculates the Euclidean distance from the current agent position to the maze exit and uses the returned value as a first approximation of the fitness score. After that, the fitness score (distance to the maze exit) is compared with the exit range value. If the fitness score is less or equal to the exit range value, we assign it the final value of <kbd>1.0</kbd>. Otherwise, the normalized fitness score is calculated as a division of the difference between the final and initial distances from the agent to the maze exit by the initial distance. Sometimes, this can lead to a negative value of the normalized fitness value, which is corrected by comparing the fitness value with <kbd>0.01</kbd> and making the necessary amendments.</span></p>

<p>We start our experiments related to the creation of the successful maze navigation agent with a simple maze configuration. The simple maze configuration, while having the deceptive <em>local optima cul-de-sacs</em> discussed earlier, has a relatively straightforward path from the start point to the exit point.</p>
<p>The following diagram represents the maze configuration used for this experiment:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767 image-border" src="assets/a30ae052-0e37-42e9-bc05-602ff422106d.png" style="width:27.00em;height:11.58em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="s1">The simple maze configuration</span></div>
<p>The maze in the diagram has two specific positions marked with filled circles. The top-left circle denotes the starting position of the maze navigator agent. The bottom-right circle marks the exact location of the maze exit that needs to be found by the maze solver. The maze solver is required to reach the vicinity of the maze exit point denoted by the specific exit range area around it in order to complete the task.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>According to the objective function definition, the maximum value of the navigator agent fitness score that can be obtained by reaching the maze exit area is <kbd>1.0</kbd>. We are also expecting that the initial configuration of the controller ANN is more complicated than in the previous experiments described earlier in the book, and this will impact the speed of the algorithm's execution. Due to this, it would take too long on a moderate PC to complete the neuroevolution algorithm with a significantly large genome population. But at the same time, the task at hand is much more complicated than in previous experiments and requires using a wider search area for successful solution exploration. Thus, through trial and error, we found that the population size can be set to <kbd>250</kbd>.</p>
<p>The following section from the configuration file contains the definition of the parameters we've just discussed:</p>
<pre>[NEAT]<br/>fitness_criterion = max<br/>fitness_threshold = 1.0<br/>pop_size = 250<br/>reset_on_extinction = False</pre>
<p>The initial configuration of the phenotype ANN includes <kbd>10</kbd> input nodes, <kbd>2</kbd> output nodes, and <kbd>1</kbd> hidden node. The input and output nodes correspond to the input sensors and the control signal outputs. The hidden node is provided to introduce non-linearity from the start of the neuroevolutionary process and to save time for the evolution process to discover it. The ANN configuration is as follows:</p>
<pre>num_hidden = 1<br/>num_inputs = 10<br/>num_outputs = 2</pre>
<p>To extend the solution search area, we need to boost the speciation of the population to try different genome configurations within a limited number of generations. This can be done either by reducing the compatibility threshold or by increasing the values of the coefficients that are used to perform the calculation of genome compatibility scores.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we used both amendments because the fitness function landscape is deceptive, and we need to emphasize even tiny changes in the genome configurations to create a new species. The following configuration parameters are affected:</p>
<pre>[NEAT]<br/>compatibility_disjoint_coefficient = 1.1<br/>[DefaultSpeciesSet]<br/>compatibility_threshold = 3.0</pre>
<p>We are particularly interested in creating the optimal configuration of a maze solver control ANN that has a minimum number of hidden nodes and connections. The optimal ANN configuration is less computationally expensive during training by the neuroevolutionary process, as well as during the inference phase in a maze-solving simulator. The optimal ANN configuration can be produced by reducing the likelihood of adding new nodes, as shown in the following snippet from the NEAT configuration file:</p>
<pre>node_add_prob          = 0.1<br/>node_delete_prob       = 0.1</pre>
<p>Finally, we allow the neuroevolutionary process to exploit not only the ANN configurations with feed-forward connections, but also recurrent ones. By having the recurrent connections, we enable the possibility for the ANN to have a memory and become a state machine. This happens to be beneficial for the evolutionary process. The following configuration hyperparameter controls this behavior:</p>
<pre>feed_forward            = False</pre>
<p>The hyperparameters described in this section were found to be beneficial to the NEAT algorithm that is used in the experiment to create a successful maze-solving agent within a limited number of generations.</p>

<p class="p1">Further, we discuss the essential parts of the experiment runner's implementation that were not addressed previously in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">We begin by initializing the maze simulation environment with the following lines:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    maze_env_config = os.path.join(local_dir, '%s_maze.txt' % <br/>                                   args.maze)<br/>    maze_env = maze.read_environment(maze_env_config)</pre>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px"><span class="s1"><kbd>args.maze</kbd> refers to the command-line argument supplied by the user when starting the Python script and refers to the type of maze environment with which we would like to experiment. It can have two values: <em>medium</em> and <em>hard</em>. The former refers to the simple maze configuration that we use in this experiment.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>After that, we set the specific seed number for the random number generator, create the NEAT configuration object, and create the <kbd>neat.Population</kbd> object using the created configuration object:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    seed = 1559231616<br/>    random.seed(seed)<br/>    config = neat.Config(neat.DefaultGenome, <br/>                         neat.DefaultReproduction,<br/>                         neat.DefaultSpeciesSet, <br/>                         neat.DefaultStagnation,<br/>                         config_file)<br/>    p = neat.Population(config)</pre>
<div class="packt_infobox">It happens that the random seed value found in the double-pole balancing experiment is suitable for this experiment too. We can assume that we found a random attractor that is specific to the stochastic process implemented by the NEAT-Python library. Later in the book, we will check whether this is true for other experiments as well.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now we are ready to create the appropriate maze simulation environment and store it as a global variable to simplify access to it from the fitness evaluation callback functions:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    global trialSim<br/>    trialSim = MazeSimulationTrial(maze_env=maze_env, <br/>                                   population=p)</pre>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px"><span class="s1">The <kbd>MazeSimulationTrial</kbd> object holds fields that provide access to the original maze simulation environment and to the record store used to save the evaluation results of the maze-solver agents. At each call to the fitness evaluation callback function, <kbd>eval_fitness(genome_id, genome, config, time_steps=400)</kbd>, the original maze simulation environment will be duplicated and will be used for the maze-solving simulation by a specific solver agent for 400 time steps. After that, the full statistics about the maze-solver agent, including its final position within the maze, will be collected from the environment and added to the record store.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The following code has become standard for our experiments, and it is related to adding various statistics reporters:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    p.add_reporter(neat.StdOutReporter(True))<br/>    stats = neat.StatisticsReporter()<br/>    p.add_reporter(stats)<br/>    p.add_reporter(neat.Checkpointer(5, <br/>                 filename_prefix='%s/maze-neat-checkpoint-' % <br/>                 trial_out_dir))</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The reporters are used to display the intermediate results of the neuroevolution process to the console, as well as to collect more detailed statistics that will be rendered after the process is completed.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Finally, we run the neuroevolution process for the specified number of generations and check whether the solution has been found:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    start_time = time.time()<br/>    best_genome = p.run(eval_genomes, n=n_generations)<br/>    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time<br/>    solution_found = (best_genome.fitness &gt;= \<br/>                      config.fitness_threshold)<br/>    if solution_found:<br/>        print("SUCCESS: The stable maze solver controller was found!!!")<br/>    else:<br/>        print("FAILURE: Failed to find the stable maze solver controller!!!")</pre>
<p>We assume that a solution has been found if the best genome returned by the NEAT-Python library has a fitness score that is greater than or equal to the fitness threshold value set in the configuration file (<kbd>1.0</kbd>). The elapsed time is calculated to print how long it took to complete the process.</p>

<p>After <kbd>144</kbd> generations of evolution, the successful maze-solver agent is found at generation <kbd>145</kbd>. The console output for the last generation is as follows:</p>

<p>In the console output, you can see that the successful maze solver controller was <span>found during evolution</span> and was able to reach the maze exit area in 388 steps from the allotted 400. The configuration of the control ANN of the successful maze solver consists of 2 output nodes and 1 hidden node, with 11 connections in between these nodes and from the inputs. The final configuration of the controller ANN is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-768 image-border" src="assets/1f5be19e-6d05-4715-8a90-d99e2c4d8c7f.png" style="width:39.00em;height:17.00em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="s1">The ANN configuration controlling a successful solver of a simple maze</span></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is interesting to look at the graph to study how different sensor inputs influence the output control signals. We can see that the ANN configuration completely ignores the inputs from the front and left rangefinder sensors (<strong>RF_FR</strong> and <strong>RF_L</strong>) and from the backward pie-slice radar sensor (<strong>RAD_B</strong>) of the robot. At the same time, the linear and angular velocities of the robot are controlled by unique combinations of other sensors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, we can see the aggregation of the left and right pie-slice radar sensors (<strong>RAD_L</strong> and <strong>RAD_R</strong>) with the backward rangefinder (<strong>RF_B</strong>) through the hidden node, which then relayed an aggregated signal to a node controlling the angular velocity. If we take a look at the simple maze configuration image shown in this chapter (see the <span>simple maze configuration image)</span>, the aggregation seems pretty natural. This allows the robot to turn around and continue to explore the maze when it is trapped in dead ends, where the local fitness optima are located.</span></p>
<p>The fitness scores of the solver agents over generations is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-769 image-border" src="assets/7742ca6f-7471-4c1c-a546-46feb0ed5a9e.png" style="width:36.42em;height:28.75em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="s1">The average fitness scores over generations</span></div>
<p>In this plot, we can see that the evolutionary process was able to produce pretty successful maze-solver agents at generation <kbd>44</kbd> with a fitness score of <strong>0.96738</strong>. But it took an additional 100 generations to evolve the genome that encodes the ANN of the successful maze-solver agent.</p>
<p>Also, it is interesting to note that the boost in performance at generation <kbd>44</kbd> is generated by the species with ID <kbd>1</kbd>, but the genome of the successful maze solver belongs to a species with ID <kbd>7</kbd>, which was not even known at the time of the first spike. The species producing the champion appeared after 12 generations and remained in the population until the end, preserving the beneficial mutation and elaborating over it.</p>
<p>The speciation over generations is shown in the following plot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-770 image-border" src="assets/496ddb2e-cbce-463a-8e06-8079fe6bd57c.png" style="width:33.58em;height:26.33em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span class="s1">The speciation over generations</span></div>
<p>On the speciation plot, we can see the species with ID <kbd>7</kbd> marked in pink. This species ultimately produced the genome of the successful maze solver during the evolutionary process. The size of species 7 varies considerably throughout its life, and at one time it was the only species in the entire population for several generations (from 105 until 108).</p>

<p>In this experiment, we presented a new visualization method that allows us to visually discern the performance of various species in the evolutionary process. The visualization can be performed using the following command, executed from the working directory of the experiment:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python visualize.py -m medium -r out/maze_objective/medium/data.pickle --width 300 --height 150</strong></pre>
<p>The command loads records about the fitness evaluation of each maze-solving agent during the evolution, which is stored in the <kbd>data.pickle</kbd> file. After that, it draws the final positions of the agents <span>on the maze map </span>at the end of the maze-solving simulation. Each agent's final position is presented as a color-coded circle. The color of the circle encodes the species to which the particular agent belongs. Each species produced during the evolution has a unique color code. The results of this visualization can be seen in the following plot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-771 image-border" src="assets/0618c36d-4f70-4b38-91e4-9c565ea53733.png" style="width:31.83em;height:30.50em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>The visualization of the evaluation of the solver agents</span></div>
<p>To make the visualization more informative, we have introduced the fitness threshold to filter out the most performant species. The top subplot shows the final positions of the solver agents belonging to the champion species (the fitness score is above <strong>0.8</strong>). As you can see, the organisms belonging to these six species are active explorers, who have genes inciting search through unknown places in the maze. Their final locations are distributed almost uniformly through the maze area around the starting point and have a low density at the local optima <em>cul-de-sacs</em>.</p>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>At the same time, you can see in the bottom subplot that the evolutionary losers demonstrate more conservative behavior, concentrating mainly near the walls in the starting area and in the strongest local optima region—the biggest <em>cul-de-sac</em>, which is at the bottom of the maze.</p>

<p>The next experiment in this chapter is to run the neuroevolution process to find an agent that can solve a maze with a more complex configuration of walls. This hard-to-solve maze configuration introduces powerful local fitness optima traps and does not have a straightforward route from the start position of the agent to the exit area of the maze. You can see the maze configuration in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-772 image-border" src="assets/b6a9ca88-aa2a-4fa0-b0b9-976e1312b55a.png" style="width:20.25em;height:19.33em;"/></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maze configuration has its start position in the bottom-left corner, marked with a green circle, and the position of the maze exit point is in the top-left corner, marked with a red circle. You can see that, to solve the maze, the navigator agent must develop a complex control strategy that allows it to avoid the local fitness optima traps around the starting point. The control strategy needs to be able to follow an elaborate trajectory from the starting point to the exit, which has several turns and more local optima traps.</span></p>

<p>For this experiment, we will use the same hyperparameters that we used in the simple maze solving experiment. Our idea is to have the same initial conditions for the neuroevolutionary algorithm and to see whether it can evolve a successful solver agent for a different, more complex maze configuration. This will indicate how well the algorithm generalizes using the hyperparameter settings used for a different maze configuration.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, we will use the same experiment runner implementation and the same NEAT hyperparameters settings as in the previous experiment. But we will configure the different maze environment as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python maze_experiment.py -m hard -g 500</strong></pre>
<p>After a while, when the experiment is over, we see that even after <kbd>500</kbd> generations of evolution, a successful maze solver has not been found. The best genome obtained using the neuroevolution algorithm encodes a bizarre and non-functional <span>controller ANN </span>configuration, which is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-773 image-border" src="assets/86d45012-74e5-49fd-b7e1-b5d3cd3ee482.png" style="width:40.08em;height:21.25em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span class="s1">ANN configuration controlling the solver of the hard-to-solve maze</span></div>
<p>It can be seen in the graph that the rotation of the robot depends only on the frontal rangefinder sensor (<strong>RF_FR</strong>), and the linear movement is controlled by a combination of several rangefinders and radar sensors. Such control configuration leads to simplified linear movements of the robot until a wall <span>is detected </span>in front of the robot. Our assumption about motion patterns is confirmed when we look at the visualization of the agent evaluation records:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774 image-border" src="assets/5c570b8e-b28f-4f8f-afbe-59f83f72ed85.png" style="width:15.75em;height:33.00em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span class="s1">The visualization of solver agents' evaluation records</span></div>
<p>The visualization of the final positions of the solver agents demonstrates that most species are trapped around the start position, where some areas of local fitness score optima are located. None of the species could even show a fitness score above our threshold (<strong>0.8</strong>). Also, as we mentioned earlier, there are clearly distinguishable vertical lines formed by the final positions of the solver agents (gray dots creating vertical columns). This confirms our assumption about the incorrect configuration of the controller ANN that was encoded by the best genome found during the evolutionary process.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The average fitness scores over generations are shown in the following plot:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-775 image-border" src="assets/8988407f-0d34-4c5e-9cb0-823a070d778c.png" style="width:30.75em;height:24.50em;"/></p>
<div class="p1 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span class="s1">The average fitness score over generations</span></div>
<p>In the plot of the average fitness scores, we can see that the neuroevolutionary process was able to significantly increase the fitness scores of solver agents in the very first generations, but after that it reached a plateau, showing no improvements. This means that a further increase in the number of evolutionary generations does not make any sense, and other measures need to be taken to improve the performance of the neuroevolutionary process.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this chapter, you have learned about a class of planning and control problems that use goal-oriented fitness functions that have a deceptive <span>definition </span>landscape. In this landscape, there are multiple traps created by the local optima areas of the fitness function that mislead the solution search process, which is based only on the fitness score calculated as a derivative of the distance from the agent to the goal. </span>You have learned that the conventional goal-oriented fitness function can help the search process to create a successful maze navigator agent for a simple maze configuration, but failed with a more complex maze due to the local optima traps.</p>
<p>We presented a useful visualization method that allowed us to visualize the final positions of all evaluated agents on the maze map. With this visualization, you can make assumptions about the performance of the evolutionary process. You can then make decisions about changes to the configuration settings that may lead to further performance improvements.</p>
<p>Also, you have learned that when there is a higher chance of fitness function convergence in the local optima, the neuroevolution process tends to produce fewer species. In extreme cases, it creates only one species, which impedes innovation and hinders the evolutionary process. To avoid this, you learned how speciation can be boosted by changing the value of the compatibility disjoint coefficient, which is used in the calculation of the genome compatibility factor. This coefficient controls the weight that will be assigned to the excess or disjoint parts of genomes being compared. Higher coefficient values increase the importance of topological differences in the compared genomes and allow more diverse genomes to belong to the same species.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will present the NS optimization method, which is better at solving deceptive tasks such as maze navigation.</p>
